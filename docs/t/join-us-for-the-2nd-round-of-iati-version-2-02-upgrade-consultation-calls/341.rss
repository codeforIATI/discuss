    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/join-us-for-the-2nd-round-of-iati-version-2-02-upgrade-consultation-calls/341</link>
    <description>Following popular demand and feedback to improve the upgrade process, the IATI Tech Team will soon be running our second round of public consultation calls.  This follows the initial calls run in early October, which were attended by NGOs and donor government publishers, as well as data users.

We welcome members of the IATI community to join us to discuss any aspect of the upgrade process, and to join further discussions on the practical implementation of each proposal.

This next round of calls will take place on the following dates/times:

 - Monday 2nd November @ 13:00 UTC/GMT 
 - Tuesday 3rd November @ 15:00 UTC/GMT 
 - Wednesday 4th November @ 09:00 UTC/GMT

These sessions will take place using GoToMeeting, with access available through internet or via a choice of telephone dial-in numbers.  [Click here to sign-up to a session][1], and we will send full details of how to join and get involved.
