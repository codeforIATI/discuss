    <title>Emergency Attention need for best advice</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/emergency-attention-need-for-best-advice/1153</link>
    <description>Dear All dream presenter,
I&#39;m Arif From Bangladesh. Volunteer of Bangladesh Awami Volunteer League (Organ of Bangladesh Awami League) and UN. I&#39;m so much optimistic to develop my career and my country development. To learn and shine up knowledge I&#39;m attending workshop, seminar and training program. 
Very recently I got a chance to attend workshop (14Dec - 16Dec 2017) arrange by European Commission Joint Research Center, Ispra, Italy. 
My Organization and friends sponsored airticket, and browse to get information of Italy Visa in  their website, I&#39;m so afraid about to get the Visa to enter Italy specially about visa application and approval duration. 
Only 3days left to my flight  what should I do? Is there anyone who can help by advice or suggestions?

Best Regards and Thank you so much</description>
