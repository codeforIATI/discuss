    <title>New: IATI business case framework</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/new-iati-business-case-framework/610</link>
    <description>Recently a new business case framework was created. It is the initiative of Mika Välitalo of Plan Finland. Various parties were involved to give input. It is now shared online. So what is it for?

* to help organisations understand the benefits of using the IATI standard;

* to enable them to decide to which extent they want to invest in adopting the standard;

* to get a feel for valuation of the benefits over time (the business case part). 

A blog describing the framework can be found here: http://akvo.org/blog/mapping-iati-a-business-case-framework/

I hope it&#39;s useful. Feel free to help improve it further. And to point it out to others.</description>

            <p>Thanks for sharing Marten!  I’ve only had a quick look but have filed it for future reference - I will make sure the Canadian community is aware and will think of how best we may use it. .</p>
