    <title>IATI and blended finance transparency</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/iati-and-blended-finance-transparency/1760</link>
    <description>I just got sent a [survey](https://survey2018.oecd.org/Survey.aspx?s=a0e3f03193004b01891f26cc01d846e9) where the &#39;[THK Roadmap OECD/SDG etc group](http://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-topics/tri-hita-karana-roadmap-for-blended-finance.htm)&#39; are looking for suggestions about how to improve the transparency of blended finance - and I think IATI is probably a great fit for their needs - is someone at the IATI secretariat able to reach out to them on to see it can happen?</description>
