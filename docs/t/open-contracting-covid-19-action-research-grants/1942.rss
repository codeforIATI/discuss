    <title>Open Contracting: COVID-19 Action Research Grants</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/open-contracting-covid-19-action-research-grants/1942</link>
    <description>I noticed that the Open Contracting Partnership (cc @James_McKinney) have published a [guidance page and request for proposals](https://www.open-contracting.org/what-is-open-contracting/covid19/) relating to $3,000 action research projects on procurement data and COVID-19

Alongside the current guidance and discussions of how best to use the IATI Standard, would we expect to also see something similar from &quot;IATI&quot; (board / secretariat / data use task force / publishers / donors), perhaps?</description>
