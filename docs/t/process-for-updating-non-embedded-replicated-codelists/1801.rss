    <title>Process for updating non-embedded (replicated) codelists?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/process-for-updating-non-embedded-replicated-codelists/1801</link>
    <description>Hi there,

The process for getting non-embedded (replicated) codelist changes into the standard was previously documented here: https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Extra-Documentation/blob/9c54e586/en/codelists-guides/codelist-management.rst#updates-to-non-embedded-codelists

I don’t know if this process has changed, but I don’t think it’s documented anymore. See: http://reference.iatistandard.org/203/codelists-guides/codelist-management/#non-embedded-codelists-replicated

What is the process now? I’m asking specifically with reference to the recent (July) DAC codelist updates, as well as [this bugfix](https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Codelists-NonEmbedded/pull/302) to re-add a number of removed withdrawn sector codes.

Thanks,</description>
