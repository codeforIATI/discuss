    <title>Extending organisation role: common usage?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/extending-organisation-role-common-usage/1415</link>
    <description>Hello, I&#39;m looking for examples of common usage for the Extending organisation role. Does anyone use it in their data, or know of organisations that use it?

As a reminder, the [IATI guidance](https://www.bond.org.uk/effectiveness/open-information-and-ngos) states that an extending organisation is:

**An organisation that manages the budget and direction of an activity on behalf of the funding organisation.**

What I want to find out what does common usage look like? For example:

1. Where the funding and extending organisation are part of the same organisation (ie govt departments are extending, the govt Treasury is the funding organisation or a local office of an NGO is disbursing funds on behalf of a central office).
2. Where an organisation is contracted as a fund manager for another funding organisation and managing disbursements.

And how in practice are publishers differentiating from the Accountable role?

**An organisation responsible for oversight of the activity and its outcomes**

Hope people are happy to share their examples - posting a link to the activity on d-portal would be great.

(Please note that I&#39;m looking for examples of where organisations are already using it in their data, rather than theoretical discussion - hope that&#39;s ok!)</description>

            <p>Hey Sarah,</p>
<p>Looking at <a href="http://dev.dashboard.iatistandard.org/element/iati-activity_participating-org_@role.html" rel="nofollow noopener">the Dashboard</a>, USAID has a high number of activities with the <code>@role</code> element.</p>
<p><a href="http://d-portal.org/ctrack.html?search&amp;publisher=US-GOV-1#view=act&amp;aid=US-GOV-1-AID-442-A-13-00003" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://d-portal.org/ctrack.html?search&amp;publisher=US-GOV-1#view=act&amp;aid=US-GOV-1-AID-442-A-13-00003</a></p>
<p>This example shows the publisher with an <code>Extending</code> role. However, it also states that USAID has an <code>Accountable</code> role.</p>
<p>Is this a valid example?</p>
