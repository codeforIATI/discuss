    <title>Consultations on definitions of &quot;local organizations&quot;</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/consultations-on-definitions-of-local-organizations/909</link>
    <description>I came across info on consultations underway regarding the definitions of &quot;local&quot; organizations in this article:
https://www.irinnews.org/analysis/2017/03/27/local-aid-agencies-still-waiting-bigger-share-funding-cake 
&quot;Consultations are under way on a relatively strict definition of what counts as local, one that excludes local affiliates of international NGOs (see box), and the findings of a survey conducted by aid consultancy Development Initiatives are due to be fed back to the Grand Bargain process before its annual meeting in June.&quot;

Since these definitions will affect/change the &quot;Organization Type&quot; codelists (both DAC and IATI ones), I was wondering whether/how one can weigh in. 

Anyone knows?</description>

            <p>Dear Yohanna</p>
<p>The definitions as in the article are now before the Grand Bargain group for their meeting next Tuesday, and I think the localisation sub-group has more or less agreed them. There are some contentious issues as you would imagine, perhaps most touchy being organisations like World Vision India.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Ben</p>

            <p>Thanks Wendy for responding and pointing out the V2.03 discussion.</p>
<p>Is the list of org types &amp; associated definitions in the article accurate?  If so, I would have concerns about them - especially about the distinction made between “national” and “local”.  Where is the discussion about this list taking place, mostly?</p>
<p>I also share the concerns raised by OJ in the V2.03 discussion you linked to. I’m not entirely clear however how all this (the Grand Bargain-related discussion mentioned in the article and the V2.03 proposed changes) fits together.</p>

            <p>Thanks for flagging <a class="mention" href="/u/yohannaloucheur">@YohannaLoucheur</a>  and the proposals for V2.03 of the Standard do include <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/organisation-type-codes-additions/858">adding two new organisation types</a> that are intended to distinguish between affiliated country offices of INGOs and other ‘in country’  community organisations</p>
<p>However, do you or others think they need to go further?</p>
