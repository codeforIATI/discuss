    <title>Disaggregation of results</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/disaggregation-of-results/449</link>
    <description>Hi all,

Following the changes in v2.02, I was wondering about the disaggregation of results. In [this discussion](http://support.iatistandard.org/entries/79499149-Support-disaggregation-of-performance-data), the addition of dimension and location nodes per target or actual has been introduced and also the idea of allowing more than 1 actual or target node.

However, it seems that allowing more than 1 target/actual node [has not been taken along](http://iatistandard.org/202/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/result/indicator/period/target/) in the standard. The IATI validator shows an error when using multiple target or actual elements as well.

So I was wondering if it is possible to add this to the discussion of the next version again. And, as a new suggestion, also allow for disaggregation of the indicator&#39;s baseline, similar to the target and actual elements.

Kind regards,
Kasper</description>
