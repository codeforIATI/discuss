    <title>Replace assumption of 100% if only one sector published with rule</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/replace-assumption-of-100-if-only-one-sector-published-with-rule/1841</link>
    <description>Currently the guidance is that &quot;f the activity has only one sector, then it is presumed that 100% of the funding is going to that sector&quot;.

This (as with all of the &#39;assumption&#39; based rules) makes it harder for data users. The &#39;assumption&#39; of 100% could be replaced by a rule that requires a percentage value to be given for all sectors added, and therefore that this should be 100% where only one sector is provided.</description>

<p>This (as with all of the ‘assumption’ based rules) makes it harder for data users. The ‘assumption’ of 100% could be replaced by a rule that requires a percentage value to be given for all sectors added, and therefore that this should be 100% where only one sector is provided.</p>
