    <title>[Approved] New Organisation Identifier: XI-IATI-KHF</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/approved-new-organisation-identifier-xi-iati-khf/2003</link>
    <description>The following addition to the IATI Organisation Identifier list has been proposed for The King Hussein Foundation (KHF).

The organisation was established in Jordan, 1999 to serve as an enduring commitment to His Majesty King Hussein&#39;s humanitarian vision and legacy. Due to this special circumstance, they are not registered via a recognised [registration agency](http://org-id.guide/results?structure=all&amp;coverage=JO&amp;sector=all) and using tax codes are not sufficient. The XI-IATI identifier has been pursued.

**Code:**  XI-IATI-KHF

**Name:**  The King Hussein Foundation (KHF)

**Description:**  Their mission is to build upon King Hussein&#39;s lifelong commitment to peace, sustainable community development and cross-cultural understanding through national and regional programs that promote education and leadership, economic empowerment and participatory decision-making.

**URL:**  http://www.kinghusseinfoundation.org/

If no objection is received this XI-IATI code will be approved and added in a week.</description>
