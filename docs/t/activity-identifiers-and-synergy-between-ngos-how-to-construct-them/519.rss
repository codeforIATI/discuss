    <title>Activity identifiers and synergy between NGOs: how to construct them?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/activity-identifiers-and-synergy-between-ngos-how-to-construct-them/519</link>
    <description>When several NGOs work together for the same outcome, which ID do we need to give for this outcome/activity since the ID activity should be chosen in intern by each organization? In this case, is there any &quot;rule&quot; for writing the ID? Or organizations are free to choose the ID they want? Do they need to insert the ID organization of each organization that are in synergy in the ID activity? I think a fictional example with an ID could help us to understand this issues. Do you have any example for that?</description>

            <p>When several NGOs work together for the same outcome, which ID do we need to give for this outcome/activity since the ID activity should be chosen in intern by each organization? In this case, is there any “rule” for writing the ID? Or organizations are free to choose the ID they want? Do they need to insert the ID organization of each organization that are in synergy in the ID activity? I think a fictional example with an ID could help us to understand this issues.
