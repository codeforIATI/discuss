    <title>Open Source Data Science Masters</title>

    <description>@bjelkeman  tweeted about this yesterday. 

&gt; Thomas Bjelkeman @bjelkeman  ·  Oct 12
&gt; If I was just about to go to university, I&#39;d go to the uni that allowed me to study this: #datascience  http://datasciencemasters.org/ 

The Open-Source Data Science Masters is an open-source curriculum for learning Data Science, built up from open and free resources. The topics covered are highly relevant to IATI and to the wider post-2015 Data Revolution. These are the skills the development community needs right now, and will increasingly need in the future. 

Would people in the IATI community be interested in forming a virtual learning group to work through the curriculum together and support/mentor each other? I&#39;m sure we would all benefit from a community supporting our continued professional development.

If you&#39;re interested, please indicate in the comments below. Please contribute any suggestions on the next steps and how we might actually run such a community.</description>

            <p>Great idea John. I just completed an on-line course on Open Data by Delft University of Technology. To have a course on Open Source Data Science Master will really be wonderful.</p>

            <p>Hello Johan,<br>
Yes, you are absolutely right, insights from data is very important.<br>
what I suggest is to make aground for all of the participants, is to join <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1?utm_medium=listingPage" rel="nofollow noopener">Coursera datascience specialization</a>, this is the only free track available to my knowledge…<br>
I already completed 5 courses of them, and the courses is fantastic but needs more hours of study time than they suggest.</p>

            <p>Hi John,<br>
Yes What you suggest is a great idea. I may be too late though … I’ve just logged on now to this discussion facility from your latest newsletter. I would be very interested in an on line course on open source data.<br>

            <p>Thanks John. As you say, the international development community needs this type of knowledge and it is a great idea you had at working on this together, like a virtual university course. Maybe we could even get some university to support us.</p>
<p>This stretches beyond IATI, but maybe we can just host a sub-category here until we need something bigger?</p>
