    <title>Register for the IATI SDG Publishing Webinars- 30 October &amp; 6 November</title>

    <description>In September IATI published guidance on [how to use the IATI Standard for publishing and using data on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Xg8OwtFATaD5iMFFCrJyOibw7uQX_Dd8).

The guidance is targeted at publishers who already have a knowledge of IATI and are looking to increase the usability of their data. It provides instructions on how to align activities with the SDG Goals, Targets and Indicators.

We’re holding two webinars to take publishers through the guidance, explain in more detail how to add SDG data into their IATI files, and answer any questions. The webinars will focus on:

1. Demonstrating how to report SDG Goals &amp; Targets using the &lt;tag&gt; element.

2. Demonstrating how to report SDG Indicators as part of the &lt;result&gt; element.

Participants should read the IATI SDG Guidance: [Publishing SDG data using the IATI Standard](https://iatistandard.org/documents/836/Publishing_SDG_data_using_the_IATI_Standard_September_2019.pdf) in advance. It would also be helpful to send in questions ahead of the webinar via the Zoom registration links below or by emailing support@iatistandard.org.
