    <title>UX (user experience) consultants/web agencies wanted!</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/ux-user-experience-consultants-web-agencies-wanted/665</link>
    <description>I am IATI&#39;s Communications Advisor. 

We are looking for recommendations for UX (user experience) consultants/web agencies as part of our work to develop user personas and map user journeys. 

We would be particularly interested in contacts who have experience in designing for non-profit initiatives. The outcome of this will inform ongoing work to understand how current IATI websites can better meet user needs.

We would be grateful if you could let us know of any useful contacts that you may have. Do post below, or email me: rohini.simbodyal@devinit.org</description>
