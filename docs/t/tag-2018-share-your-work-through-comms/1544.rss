    <title>TAG 2018: Share your work through comms</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/tag-2018-share-your-work-through-comms/1544</link>
    <description>Hi all,

I’m working on comms for the TAG 2018 (before/during/after).

If you want to promote your work or have any other comms ideas, do get in contact with me. You could consider writing a blog, newspost, tweet or even doing a short video interview!

Looking forward to seeing you in Kathmandu!
