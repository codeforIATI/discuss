    <description>IATI’s former website aidtransparency.net will be switched off on Monday 29 October 2018.

**Use iatistandard.org** 

Please use [iatistandard.org](http://iatistandard.org/) to access content previously provided on aidtransparency.net including news, governance and event information. 

Launched in July 2018, we’ve continued to improve functionality, add new content and transfer key resources to [iatistandard.org](http://iatistandard.org/). Our new website provides easy-to-understand content, a new step-by-step publishing guide and an updated look using IATI’s new brand. 

Over the last few months, we have worked to promote the new site and to give users the opportunity to become familiar with the new content and navigation. We hope that we’ve allowed sufficient time for users to get ready to transition away from using aidtransparency.net. 

If you have any questions about the shift away from aidtransparency.net or using [iatistandard.org](http://iatistandard.org/), please contact the IATI support desk: [support@iatistandard.org](mailto:support@iatistandard.org?subject=aidtransparency.net%20switch-off).</description>

            <p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>Thanks for your post about ensuring important historical content from <a href="http://aidtransparency.net/">aidtransparency.net</a> is made available through <a href="https://iatistandard.org/">iatistandard.org</a>. We have now redirected <a href="http://aidtransparency.net/">aidtransparency.net</a> to <a href="https://iatistandard.org/">iatistandard.org</a> and made all documents from <a href="http://aidtransparency.net/">aidtransparency.net</a> accessible from the same URLs using redirects to <a href="https://iatistandard.org/">iatistandard.org</a>.</p>
<p>We’ve also implemented your suggestion of linking all Steering Committee papers to <a href="https://iatistandard.org/en/about/governance/members-assembly-documents/">https://iatistandard.org/en/about/governance/members-assembly-documents/</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks again for raising this important issue. Do let us know if you face any specific issues accessing documents or any historical content on <a href="http://iatistandard.org">iatistandard.org</a> by emailing <a href="mailto:support@iatistandard.org">support@iatistandard.org</a>.</p>
<p>All the best,</p>
<p>Sam</p>

            <p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/iati-techteam">@IATI-techteam</a> – just wanted to follow up on the above, seeing as today is supposed to be the day that <a href="http://aidtransparency.net" rel="nofollow noopener">aidtransparency.net</a> is switched off. It would be great to avoid losing access to all this historical information.</p>

            <p>Congratulations again to <a class="mention" href="/u/iati-techteam">@IATI-techteam</a> for all the hard work done on the new website!</p>
<p>When the website was launched in July a few of us <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/iati-website-is-live/1379/7?u=markbrough">requested that the old website be archived</a> rather than deleted. This is important not just for historical interest but also for resolving current discussions. We were <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/iati-website-is-live/1379/7?u=markbrough">assured by the Secretariat</a> that:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group" data-post="7" data-topic="1379" data-full="true">
<div class="title">
<div class="quote-controls"></div>
<img alt width="20" height="20" src="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/user_avatar/discuss.iatistandard.org/bill_anderson/40/453_1.png" class="avatar"><a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/iati-website-is-live/1379/7">IATI Website is LIVE</a>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>The plan is to build a comprehensive archive of all historical documents accessible from the new site</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It is great to see that a lot of this has been done in the <a href="https://iatistandard.org/en/about/archive/" rel="nofollow noopener">Archive</a> section of the new website (copying the <a href="https://www.aidtransparency.net/about/archive" rel="nofollow noopener">Archive</a> section of the old website).</p>
<p>However, from a quick look it appears there are still files that will be lost  (or links that will be broken and hard to work out where the file has gone to) in switching off the new website. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a href="https://iatistandard.org/documents/482/1140-100407-Framework-for-Costs-and-Benefits-of-transparency-with-Annexes.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">cost/benefit analysis from 2009</a> has a number of references to files that I could not find at all on the new website</li>
<li>the <a href="https://iatistandard.org/en/news/annual-report-2017/" rel="nofollow noopener">2017 Annual Report news article</a> links to files that can be found elsewhere on the site but the links in that article would be broken.</li>
<li>the <a href="https://www.iatistandard.org/documents/230/IATI_Members_Assembly_2017_minutes_.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">minutes of the 2017 MA PDF</a> has the same issue (files it refers to can probably be found but links would be broken)</li>
<li>I eventually realised past <a href="https://www.aidtransparency.net/governance/steering-committee/steering-committee-documents" rel="nofollow noopener">Steering Committee documents</a> appear to be attached to individual events (<a href="https://iatistandard.org/en/events/?year=2015&amp;past=1" rel="nofollow noopener">e.g.</a>), but this was quite hard to work out and to discover the location of these documents. Any internal links in documents would also be broken. Perhaps the events could be linked to <a href="https://iatistandard.org/en/about/governance/members-assembly-documents/" rel="nofollow noopener">from this page</a>?</li>
</ul>
<p>Aside from broken links, my major concern is with documents that we don’t realise we’ve deleted or removed access to. All the issues I found were to do with files that currently sit in <code>wp-content/uploads</code> on the old website.</p>
<p>I think the easiest way of solving all these issues would be to copy the contents of <code>wp-content/uploads</code> from the old website and make it accessible from the same URLs in the new website (through redirects). This should be a super simple job and would save a lot of important historical material. It would be good to also check if there are any other folders containing a significant amount of important files but I imagine this one folder should capture pretty much everything.</p>
<p>Can the Secretariat confirm that <a href="http://aidtransparency.net" rel="nofollow noopener">aidtransparency.net</a> will not be switched off until all these files are safely stored and made accessible through the new website without breaking links? Thanks!!</p>
