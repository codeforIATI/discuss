    <title>IATI and HXL: panel, mid-level presentation, and/or tech workshop</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/iati-and-hxl-panel-mid-level-presentation-and-or-tech-workshop/691</link>
    <description>Most bottom-up humanitarian activity reports from the field (3Ws: Who, What, Where) arrive in spreadsheet format; many people who want to use IATI data and combine it with other humanitarian data also need to work with tabular formats.

The [Humanitarian Exchange Language](http://hxlstandard.org) can serve as a bridge in both directions, making it easier to import spreadsheet-type data into the IATI ecosystem, and making it easier to pull IATI data back out for integration into the humanitarian field-data ecosystem.

Possible topics:

* Topic in a policy-level humanitarian-data panel discussion (together with FTS and the Grand Bargain), focusing on bottom-up field reporting.

* Mid-level presentation on existing humanitarian 3Ws, similarities and gaps related to IATI activity reports.

* Evening tech hands-on workshop tagging real 3W spreadsheets and converting them to IATI.
