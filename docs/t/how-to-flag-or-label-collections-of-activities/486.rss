    <title>How to flag or label collections of activities?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/how-to-flag-or-label-collections-of-activities/486</link>
    <description>We would like to be able to label all activities from UK government related to the International Climate Facility (ICF). Obviously we could add &quot;ICF&quot; to every activity title or description, but is there a better, more structured way using one of the other fields?

I would rather use a core field rather than an extension as it mean that tools like OIPA and Datastore will pick that up.</description>

            <p>I had the same idea as Rory and Wendy.  We’re doing something similar with various thematic priorities.</p>

            <p>Interesting question <a class="mention" href="/u/johnadams">@JohnAdams</a>. My first thought was whether you could integrate ‘ICF’ as a value on either your own ‘Sector’ or ‘policy-marker’ code vocabularies (‘99’)? Would that work?</p>

            <p>Hello John,</p>
<p>It depends on how structured you want the element to be. One approach which would lead to fairly structured data, but using quite a flexible element is to include an additional description element of type <a href="http://iatistandard.org/202/codelists/DescriptionType/" rel="nofollow noopener"><code>4 - other</code></a> to then include a specific tag for activities related to the International Climate Facility:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-xml">  &lt;!--rest of activity--&gt;
  &lt;description type="1"&gt;
     &lt;narrative&gt;Original activity description: principle operations etc.&lt;/narrative&gt;
  &lt;/description&gt;
  &lt;description type="4"&gt;
     &lt;narrative&gt;IFC&lt;/narrative&gt;
    &lt;/description&gt;
  &lt;!--rest of activity--&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Another, more structured approach could be to use the policy marker element and a custom DFID vocabulary:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-xml">&lt;policy-marker vocabulary="99" vocabulary-uri="http://dfid.customvocabs.com/policy-marker-vocab.html" code="IFC" significance="3" /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Here you could host a page explaining the way you’ve encoded this information along with a table of values, which could be referenced in the <code>vocabulary-uri</code> attribute, and you could use the <a href="http://iatistandard.org/202/codelists/PolicySignificance/" rel="nofollow noopener"><code>significance</code></a> codelist as is.</p>
<p>Do either of these solutions look tenable to you? If not there maybe more, but I’d have to have a think!</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Rory</p>
