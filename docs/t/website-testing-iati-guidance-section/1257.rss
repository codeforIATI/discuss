    <title>Website Testing - IATI Guidance Section</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/website-testing-iati-guidance-section/1257</link>
    <description>As part of updating the IATI website, we&#39;re working with fffunction to design a new structure for the Guidance section which we want to gather feedback on.

We’re looking for people who can spare up to 15 minutes to participate in an online test session. You&#39;ll be asked group content into logical groups and order. There is no right or wrong answer, just have a go.

To participate, please use this link: https://2zui8if3.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort/04u643yz

We are looking for everyone to take part in this, whether you&#39;ve only just heard about IATI or have been working with IATI for years. Please do have a go and encourage other to do the same.

Thank you in advance for your help.
