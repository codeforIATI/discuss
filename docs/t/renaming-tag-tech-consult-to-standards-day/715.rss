    <title>Renaming &quot;TAG Tech Consult&quot; to &quot;Standards Day&quot;</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/renaming-tag-tech-consult-to-standards-day/715</link>
    <description>I hope this doesn&#39;t cause too much disruption, but ...

By labeling day 4 of the TAG as a Technical Consultation we have mistakenly created the impression that Days 2 and 3 are non-technical. The agenda on these days is as varied as the TAG has always been - including technical sessions (of both soft and hard varieties).

The addition of Day 4 was to work at reaching specific consensus on outstanding issues relating to the standard and associated rules and guidelines. 

So I hope calling Day 4 &quot;Standards Day&quot; will trip off the tongue and the brain more easily.</description>
