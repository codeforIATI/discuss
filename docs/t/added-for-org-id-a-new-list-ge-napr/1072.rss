    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/added-for-org-id-a-new-list-ge-napr/1072</link>
    <description>Following a request from an IATI publisher (via [github](https://github.com/org-id/register/issues/72)) a new list has been proposed with the code GE-NAPR.

This addition to org-id.guide has been staged https://github.com/org-id/register/pull/74

**List title**: Register of Entrepreneurial and Non-Entrepreneurial Legal Entities (Georgia)

**List description**
The National Agency of Public Registry (NAPR) of Georgia registers all legal entities in Georgia. This includes government and non-government bodies (including the private sector). The Identification Code assigned by NAPR is the same as the VAT number in Georgia. NAPR assigns codes for government bodies in addition to all non-governmental organisations (private and non-profit).

**List access details:** 
Through this web site you can search for any legal entity (individual entrepreneur, commercial legal entity, nonprofit legal entity, etc.) in Georgia.  You can also obtain their statements and scanned archive documents, as well as information about the legal form of the organization, persons with representative authority, liquidation process and other registered data.

**List search url**: https://enreg.reestri.gov.ge (Georgian lanugage)


Unless objections are raised, this proposed update will be merged on or after 17/10/2017</description>
