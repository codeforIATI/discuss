    <title>Make Baseline &amp; Period guidance Musts</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/make-baseline-period-guidance-musts/1733</link>
    <description>At 2.03 three _should_ statements (of which originally two were _musts_) should be made into _must_ statements at version 3.0.0.

The rules to be added are:

* The @value  **must**  be omitted for qualitative measures
* The @value  **must**  be included for non-qualitative measures
* The @value **must** be a valid number for all non-qualitative measures

And they are found in three places:

* iati-activities/iati-activity/result/indicator/baseline/@value
* iati-activities/iati-activity/result/indicator/period/target/@value
* iati-activities/iati-activity/result/indicator/period/actual/@value

This helps ensure the quality of data being reported, and will make it easier for data users to analyse results data.</description>
