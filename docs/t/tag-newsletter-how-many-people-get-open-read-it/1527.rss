    <title>TAG Newsletter - how many people get, open &amp; read it?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/tag-newsletter-how-many-people-get-open-read-it/1527</link>
    <description>I know I do!

It&#39;s great that this is sent every two weeks - many thanks to those that consistently make this happen --&gt; @JohnAdams @Rohini_Simbodyal &amp; others...

This would be great data for us to see though, to get a sense of how large/small/engaged the TAG community is, via the lens of the newsletter.

The set template is also very useful - I know where to look in the newsletter, and what to expect.  One suggestion I&#39;d have would be to include links to &quot;hot topics&quot; on IATI Discuss, to help people see where discussions are shaping up (particularly useful if you switch of Discuss alerts, as I do)

NB: I know it won&#39;t be possible to know how many people *actually* read the newsletter (I think!)</description>

            <p>Hi, I’m a newbie here. I get weekly updates on posts emailed and open the Mailchimp alert when it catches my eye - and when I’ve been thinking about related matters. I dont have a tech background and am still unsure as to whether discussions are orientated to those who do. This is my first post, so apols if it is off topic there’s a better thread.</p>
<p>My interest is in ‘using cloud-based collaboration to develop and deliver sustainable, co-produced social good projects, incorporating Nudge theory (Behavioural Insights),enabling data aggregation, good governance and budget transparency’</p>
<p>Cheers! Jay</p>

            <p>Steven, looking at the mailchimp stats, seems fairly consistent:</p>
<p>936 subscribers (compared with 900 in August and 875 back in Jan)<br>
25% open<br>
6% clicks</p>
<p>Clicks and opens go up dramatically when there is something specific like TAG event news or calls to action</p>
