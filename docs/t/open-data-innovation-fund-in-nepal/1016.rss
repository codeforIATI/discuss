    <description>Do you have innovative ideas on how data can be opened and harnessed to solve Nepal’s development issues? Are you looking for funding to transform your ideas into reality? Then look no further!

We are delighted to share that a new Innovation Fund on open data has been launched today – a first for Nepal. This fund – The Open Data Innovation Fund - will help Nepal’s development innovators to address development challenges by supporting with funding and advice their innovative solutions to improving the accessibility and use of (open) development data.

The Open Data Innovation Fund will be making awards of up to NPR 10,000 each for 3 to 5 successful applicants. Technical advice and guidance will be available to winning organisations to strengthen the implementation of their ideas.
