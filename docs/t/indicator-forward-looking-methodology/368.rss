    <title>Indicator Forward Looking Methodology</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/indicator-forward-looking-methodology/368</link>
    <description>Hi everyone,
I was looking at the budgets - and I don&#39;t understand if the dashboard takes into account that there should be no budget for year 2 and 3 if the activity ends next year? Do we need to publish &quot;0&quot; in those cases in order to get full score?

Also - activities often remain open or on-going for several months while waiting for reporting and possible repayments.

Thanks

            <p>Hi Carl</p>
<p>The dashboard only looks at activities that it thinks are still current in Year 2 and 3. So an activity with an end date in Year 1 is not considered for Year 2.</p>
<p>Re: activities remaining open. Our recommendation is that the end date reflects the end of activity and the status of “Post Completion” indicates that paperwork, M&amp;E, etc is still being finalised.</p>
