    <title>XI-IATI Org ID Structure Discussion</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/xi-iati-org-id-structure-discussion/1903</link>
    <description>To be clear about the current process for creating Org IDs: the  Tech Team requests an &#39;XI-IATI&#39; Org ID when there is no existing [org-id.guide](http://org-id.guide/) identifier that is suitable for their organisation; and the Org ID team cannot identify a new identifier that may be available to create for that organisation.

Currently, we simply request for `XI-IATI` + `a short acronym or abbreviation for the organisation` (i.e. [XI-IATI-ATTIC](https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/added-new-organisation-identifier-xi-iati-attic/1655)) is used and added to the list of [IATI-maintained Org IDs](http://reference.iatistandard.org/203/codelists/IATIOrganisationIdentifier/).

 In a recent XI-IATI Org ID request [post](https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/new-organisation-identifier-xi-iati-esfd/1898), it has been suggested that a country code (and perhaps an org-type code as well) could be added to XI-IATI Org IDs, to more easily identify the identity of the organisation. e.g. XI-IATI-ATTIC-TD (as Attic is based in Chad).

Further conversations have also been had in this regard previously:
- https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/added-change-the-guidance-on-xi-iati-organisation-identifiers/604
- https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/use-of-xi-identifiers-for-national-or-sub-national-ngos-and-csos/1658/14

We have created this post so that this can be discussed further while not inhibiting the publishing process for a particular organisation.</description>
