    <title>Org-id.guide- new site for Organisation Registration Agencies</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/org-id-guide-new-site-for-organisation-registration-agencies/989</link>
    <description>**What is org-id.guide?**
org-id.guide provides the easiest, quickest and most accurate way to find lists that provide organisation identifiers (unique codes and/or numbers that represent a specific organisation in a dataset). Whether it’s a charity in the UK, a company in Malaysia, or a government department in Canada, the ability to describe these different entities in a consistent way is key to opening and linking up data about their activities.

org-id.guide is funded by a collaboration of organisations working on open data standards across a range of sectors including the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI), Open Contracting Partnership, 360Giving, Joined Up Data Standards (JUDS) and the Initiative for Open Ag Funding. This collaboration of data standard bodies has agreed to provide and maintain a shared register of the lists where organisation identifiers are found at org-id.guide (replacing and updating the [IATI Organisation Registration Agency codelist](http://iatistandard.org/202/codelists/OrganisationRegistrationAgency/)). The project builds on the methodology developed by IATI of presenting identifiers in two parts – a list code, and the identifier drawn from that list.  

For more information, please also see the blog post about the[ launch of org-id.guide](http://www.aidtransparency.net/news/org-id-guide-launched).

**What does it mean for IATI users?**
[Organisation Registration Agency codelist](http://iatistandard.org/202/codelists/OrganisationRegistrationAgency/) (now organisation identifier list) is now maintained centrally by org-id.guide. org-id.guide provides a register of organisation identifier lists that allows open data publishers to locate organisation identifiers. IATI replicates the list directly from org-id.guide with the exception of the XI-IATI codelist. IATI still maintains the XI-IATI organisation identifier list, which is used when there are no other available lists that might be used to provide a stable organisation identifier.

If an organisation identifier list that you wish to use cannot be found in org-id.guide, you can submit a direct request on [Github](https://github.com/org-id/register/issues) or email contact@org-id.guide

If you have any other questions, please respond to this post or get in touch with the IATI technical support team via support@iatistandard.org</description>
