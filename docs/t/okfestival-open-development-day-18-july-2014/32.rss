    <description>We are planning a TAG side event at the [Open Knowledge Festival][1] in Berlin on Friday 18th July. This will be part of the Open Development side event, held at the Wikimedia building.

We have a couple of topics in mind that would benefit from a group of people gathered in one place:

 - A documentation sprint focussing on building up a good glossary of
   IATI terms, ideally in multiple languages. 
 - A ToolCamp, looking at the    range of tools available to generate,
   publish, curate and use IATI    data, feeding into the excellent Open
   Development Toolkit.

We are also looking for ideas from the TAG members for anything else that we could usefully achieve together. Please add your ideas below.
