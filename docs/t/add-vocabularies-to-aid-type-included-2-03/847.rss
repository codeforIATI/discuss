    <title>Add vocabularies to aid-type (included 2.03)</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/add-vocabularies-to-aid-type-included-2-03/847</link>
    <description>This proposal is part of the [2.03 upgrade process](https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/version-2-03-decimal-upgrade-index-of-proposals/838), please comment by replying below.

**Standard**
Activity

**Schema Object**
iati-activity/default-aid-type/@vocabulary
iati-activity/default-aid-type/@vocabulary-uri
iati-activity/transaction/aid-type/@vocabulary
iati-activity/transaction/aid-type/@vocabulary-uri

**Type of Change**
Schema addition
Codelist addition

**Issue**
Defining types of aid (project-type interventions, budget support, debt relief, technical cooperation, etc) is a critical piece of data for users to understand and analyse IATI data. The global standard for this classification is the OECD DAC CRS Type of Aid codelist. This is currently the only list available in the IATI standard. There are, however, use cases in which additional information may be required to define the aid modality. The standard can accommodate this by allowing additional vocabularies from recognised sources to be used in addition to the DAC list. 

**Proposal**
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow for multiple occurrences of  iati-activity/default-aid-type and   iati-activity/transaction/aid-type elements
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Occurs 
1..* 
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Add attributes iati-activity/default-aid-type/@vocabulary and iati-activity/transaction/aid-type/@vocabulary
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Definition
An code for the vocabulary aid-type classifications. If omitted the AidType codelist is assumed. The code must be a valid value in the AidTypeVocabulary codelist.
&lt;li&gt;Occurs
0..1
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add attributes iati-activity/default-aid-type/@vocabulary-uri and iati-activity/transaction/aid-type/@vocabulary-uri
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Definition
The URI where this vocabulary is defined
&lt;li&gt;Occurs
0..1
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guidelines
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each selected vocabulary should only be used once for each activity (iati-activity/default-aid-type) or transaction (iati-activity/transaction/aid-type)
&lt;li&gt;All activities and/or transactions should contain a code from the DAC Type of Aid Vocabulary
&lt;li&gt;The above guidelines should be converted to rules at the next integer upgrade.
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add AidTypeVocabulary codelist
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A non-embedded codelist should be created
&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;

**Standards Day**
It was recommended that the IATI Technical Team and IATI WP-STAT members engage with the OECD DAC with regard to future modifications to the DAC Type of Aid codelist. There was also consensus that the vocabulary approach could provide more flexibility/granularity.

            <p>Thank you <a class="mention" href="/u/oj_">@OJ_</a> and if you are able to post your proposals somewhere online you can then link to them in a post?</p>
<p>Also, in my most recent communications with the DAC they indicated that they that had asked the DAC members to position themselves on the better way to track cash-based operations. There was a general opposition to introduce another marker, so two choices were proposed :</p>
<ul>
<li>A cash flag : The project has (value 1) or has not (value 0) a cash component. (because capturing all the subtleties of different cash modalities would require a more elaborated marker, for which there is no appetite)</li>
<li>A keyword : project with a cash component would use the world “cash” in the project description, which allows us to make a research by keyword.</li>
</ul>
<p>For unrelated reasons the overall proposal was not accepted during the last WP-STAT? As a result, my understanding is that the proposal, will now follow a written procedure : the revised proposal will be sent out and DAC members will have 3 weeks to send objections. If there is no objections, the proposal will be accepted and the new codes, new cash flag/keyword will be operational for the 2018 data set, available end 2019?</p>

            <p>Sorry - I have been disconnected …</p>
<p>This is a problem that must be fixed by DAC, as I argued in London. And for that purpose I have provided a first draft, and submitted it for initial discussions in WP-STAT asap. I will mail you a copy, and if you can advise me on how to share it with any reader of this thread I would be happy to do that as well.</p>

            <p>I would prefer that we have one main aid typology since that will keep the IATI standard as close as possible to a common international standard as possible.</p>
<p>Therefore I see the Grand Bargain typology as <strong>additional</strong> typology for humanitarian aid activities, <strong>not as a replacement</strong> for the OECD/DAC typology.</p>
<p>That being said, the question remains how to model this in IATI. For me it would not be a showstopper to add the grand bargain classification as an aid typology, if there is an IATI guideline stating that:<br>
1 - the OECD/DAC aid typology is the preferred common aid typology for all constituents<br>
2 - that in addition to the OECD DAC  Aid typology, for humanitarian aid activities an additional aid typology can be published for Grand Bargain signatories.</p>
<p>As an afterthought: when looking at the 4 level Grand Bargain earmarking, I suspect it might even be possible to derive the level of earmarking directly from the OECD/DAC typology.</p>

            <p>While there is nothing intrinsically wrong in adding another element, I am personally in favour of adding vocabularies as a more flexible approach to developing the standard.</p>
<p>I also observe from a multi-stakeholder perspective that the DAC doesn’t hold a monopoly in defining aid typologies beyond its membership.</p>
<p>What, for example, will we do if we don’t get a DAC code for cash transfer programming and the<a href="http://www.cashlearning.org/news-and-events/news-and-events/post/459-walking-the-talk-the-grand-bargain--cash-transfer-programming"> Grand Bargain team</a> come up with another taxonomy?</p>

            <p>Yes, that would be fine: it would allow IATI publishers to publish on<br>
1 -  the high level earmarking (Unearmarked, Softly earmarked, Earmarked, Tigthly earmarked)</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>2 - on the detailed level  (A - L). The high level earmarking can be derived from the detail codes.</p>
<p>I am still a bit doubtful about to call this an aid typology since the whole purpose of Annex 1 is to determine the level of earmarking. Wouldn’t it be an idea to keep this distinction clear by adding this vocabulary a new element ‘Earmarking’?</p>

            <p>An earmarking codelist is, from the IATI angle, a third-party, non-embedded codelist. As is the case with DAC codelists, the content is not under our control. All we need to do is reference the codelist as a valid vocabulary.</p>

            <p>I believe we have a misunderstanding here. The discussion is not <strong>if</strong> we should add the possibility to add earmark modalities to IATI or not. The discussion is about <strong>how</strong> we should do that.</p>
<p>The Grand Bargain requirement is that donors and aid organizations are transparent about their level of earmarking, so that the goal to reduce earmarking of contributions can be monitored.</p>
<p>To meet this requirement it could be sufficient to just add an earmarking element to the activity standard, with 4 possible values defined in a codelist(‘Unearmarked’, ‘Softly earmarked’, ‘Earmarked’, ‘Tightly earmarked’).</p>
<p>I would be very reluctant to add the whole aid typology from annex 1 to the standard for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>it will increase the chance of inconsistencies when you have two aid typologies. So it will be decrease data quality and it will make aid-typology data harder to use;</li>
<li>it would mean moving away from the common standard we have right now;</li>
<li>it will mean adding a new, detailed aid-typology to donor’s and aid organizations project management systems. This will take time, if it will happen at all. So it will increase the effort and therefore the barrier to adopt the Grand Bargain requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Can anybody who has been involved in the discussion about the content of Annex 1, shed some light on this (<a class="mention" href="/u/oj_">@OJ_</a>?). The text on page 12:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Progressively reduce the earmarking of their humanitarian contributions. The aim is to aspire to achieve a global target of 30 per cent of humanitarian contributions that is non-earmarked or softly earmarked by 2020</p>
</blockquote>
<p>suggests that what is enough to make the distinction between earmarked and non-earmarked or softly earmarked.</p>

            <p>You ask what I want to do? As Technical Lead I want to reflect IATI’s commitment to the Grand Bargain (a commitment shared by many of its members including the Netherlands and Canada).</p>
<p>Signatories of the Grand Bargain have committed to the use of a system for classifying earmarking modalities which contains 12 values grouped into 4 categories.</p>
<p>If you disagree with this, is this not a matter for your humanitarian colleagues to take up in Grand Bargain channels?</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/bill_anderson">@bill_Anderson</a>:  thank, this sheds some light on this topic.</p>
<p>Concerning the classification of cash transfers apparently some work needs to be done.</p>
<p>Concerning the earmarking discussion: this reminds me of the DAC classification for core (=non-earmarked) and non-core (=earmarked) contributions. This is a part of the DAC aid-type classification. The classification above looks like a more fine-grained classification solely for the purpose of distinguishing between all shades of earmarking.</p>
<p>So the question seems to be: do you just want to indicate the level of earmarking (the first colored column) or do you want to represent all aid types (the 2nd and 3th column) in IATI. If you only want to do the former, I would say a 4 valued code list and one additional element would be enough. If you intend the latter, I would be very reluctant since we are than introducing a fully fledged new Aid typology where we already have one in the form of the international DAC standard aid typology.</p>
<p>I agree with <a class="mention" href="/u/yohannaloucheur">@YohannaLoucheur</a> that we should be careful with introducing new aid typologies.</p>

            <p>For my response on the issue of classifying cash transfers <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/enable-reporting-of-payment-via-in-kind-vouchers-or-cash-transfers/664/10">please see this post</a>.</p>
<p>The first use case for adding a vocabulary here relates to the <a href="https://interagencystandingcommittee.org/system/files/grand_bargain_final_22_may_final-2_0.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">Grand Bargain commitment</a> to reduce the earmarking of donor contributions, for which a classification system of earmarking modalities has been developed (see Annex 1 to the Grand Bargain).</p>
<p>I think it is correct for the standard to include this classification. It could be introduced as a new element, but it seemed logical to add it as an aid type vocabulary.<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/original/1X/e1cb30013af9d8ce5bee7608756ed01077399513.PNG" data-download-href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/e1cb30013af9d8ce5bee7608756ed01077399513" title="earmarking.PNG"><img src="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/e1cb30013af9d8ce5bee7608756ed01077399513_2_690x427.PNG" width="690" height="427" srcset="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/e1cb30013af9d8ce5bee7608756ed01077399513_2_690x427.PNG, https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/e1cb30013af9d8ce5bee7608756ed01077399513_2_1035x640.PNG 1.5x, https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/original/1X/e1cb30013af9d8ce5bee7608756ed01077399513.PNG 2x" data-small-upload="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/e1cb30013af9d8ce5bee7608756ed01077399513_2_10x10.png"><div class="meta">

            <p>Wouldn’t the Purpose Code be the thing that needs attention? Or a marker?</p>
<p>If DFID gives UNHCR money to do multipurpose unconditional cash grants, then the Type of Aid (which seems to describe the nature of the understanding between DFID and UNHCR in this context) does not appear  much different from UNHCR doing a range of in-kind services.</p>
<p>Couldn’t you argue that the type of aid is the same, but the manner of delivery is different, which could be captured in CRS Purpose Codes or a new Marker?</p>
