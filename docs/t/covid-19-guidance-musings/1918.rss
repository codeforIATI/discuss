    <title>Covid-19 guidance musings</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/covid-19-guidance-musings/1918</link>
    <description>Perhaps I should just wait for the webinar in 10 minutes, but I was just corresponding with @petyakangalova on the support desk re. the Covid-19 guidance.

Essentially, there&#39;s obvious scalability and useability concerns with adding free text &quot;Covid-19&quot; to the title. It gets the discoverability job done, but potentially becomes noise in activity titles as more and more programming has to adapt to a changing world. If coronavirus becomes a seasonal but unvaccinated ongoing reality, will every activity in the world eventually be suffixed as &quot;--Covid-19&quot;?

I had some brief discussions about using `&lt;tag&gt;` for Covid-19, but obviously that requires a new codelist to be added/used, and the obvious codelists are already in use in `&lt;humanitarian-scope&gt;`

But that got me thinking: what exactly *is* Covid-19? 

Sure, in &lt;humanitarian-scope&gt; it&#39;s an emergency/appeal, and for a certain audience that&#39;s sufficient. But for a more generalist (or even niche) data user/researcher, `&lt;tag&gt;` was meant to be the user-desired yet easy-on-publishers discoverability tool. Of course, that requires codelists to avoid the perils of free text. 

So aside from disaster/response codelists already spoken for, what *is* Covid-19 that makes it interesting to said researcher: a cross-cutting issue? a particular methodology (i.e. remote monitoring, local decision-making, socially distanced programming)? an international topic of concern? (To be clear, these are all poor examples that don&#39;t translate well to codelists).

I guess my question is: **has anyone else considered alternatives for tracking and tagging Covid-19 data within their donor ecosystem?** (I know you have, but I&#39;ll refrain from calling you out:-)</description>

            <p>Hey <a class="mention" href="/u/reidmporter">@reidmporter</a> – just wanted to link to the latest IATI guidance on how to report COVID-19 data, in case others haven’t yet seen it (it also contains details of the webinar you mentioned):<br>
