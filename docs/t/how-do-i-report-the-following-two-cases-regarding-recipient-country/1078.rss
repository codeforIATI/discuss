    <title>How do I report the following two cases regarding &quot;recipient-country&quot;?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/how-do-i-report-the-following-two-cases-regarding-recipient-country/1078</link>
    <description>The IATI documentation says that you have to report the country that benefits from the activity as the &quot;recipient-country.&quot; I have come to understand that when a report is being written in the Netherlands about the status of migrants in an African country, that country should be reported as &quot;recipient-country.&quot; However, I have two cases where it is a little less obvious who the recipient-country should be:

1) Imagine an activity where migrants move from ODA-country A to non-ODA country B. Which country(ies) should be reported as &quot;recipient-country&quot;?

2) Imagine an activity where Syrian refugees receive humanitarian aid in a refugee camp in Turkey. What country should be reported as &quot;recipient-country&quot;?</description>

            <p>Thank you for your replies. <a class="mention" href="/u/yohannaloucheur">@YohannaLoucheur</a> both your answers make sense to me and I will keep this guidance in mind when reporting.</p>
<p>Indeed, I agree that it would be beneficial if the guidance on this became clearer for everyone in the IATI community and not just clear for CRS reporters ( = donors who report to DAC?), especially given that more humanitarian organizations are starting to report to IATI.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If geocoding this activity, the location would definitely be Turkey. Thus the recipient-country should also be Turkey. “Syrian refugees” would appear in the activity title, description, perhaps results etc, which would help find it if needed.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If this is reported by country B, it presumably becomes in-country refugee costs (note that this cannot be reported for all migrants, only refugees).  The question seems rather about the nature of the funding/spending than the location.</p>
<p>(As a side note: these are questions that should be addressed by the DAC, not IATI. I don’t know that we have a mechanism to relay, or at least highlight, to the DAC the need for guidance in the community beyond CRS reporters.)</p>

            <p>Thanks for the question <a class="mention" href="/u/tdahlfors">@TDahlfors</a> and my suggestion would be that in both cases both countries should be reported via  for the activity with a percentage split of 50/50 or whatever proportion is most appropriate?</p>
<p>However, it is always good to hear what approach other publishers might use?</p>
