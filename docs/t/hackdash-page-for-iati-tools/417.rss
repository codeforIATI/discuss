    <title>Hackdash page for IATI tools</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/hackdash-page-for-iati-tools/417</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been looking through the links on the Developer page of the IATI website at http://iatistandard.org/201/developer/tools/ (thanks for the tip Dale!) and I came across this: https://hackdash.org/dashboards/opendev

I wondered if anyone still uses it, and whether it would be a good place to add links to newer stuff that people are working on and sharing via Github or similar? Some of it looks out of date.

PS Whatever happened to the Open Development Toolkit?</description>

            <p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/sjohns">@SJohns</a> - just been going through some old Discuss posts and saw that this one was missing a response!</p>
<p>I did some work a few weeks ago on resurrecting opendevtoolit and we got the initial site up and running here: <a href="http://opendevtoolkit.org/">http://opendevtoolkit.org/</a> Note we needed to change the top-level domain has changed from .net to .org due to a domain registration issue. We’re also in the process of updating where these URLs are referenced.</p>
<p>There is a more comprehensive site that that we’re looking to get online in the new few weeks where time allows.</p>
<p>In terms of the Hackdash page, would definitely be add new things if we can - though I think <a class="mention" href="/u/zararah">@zararah</a> is the admin for that page.</p>
