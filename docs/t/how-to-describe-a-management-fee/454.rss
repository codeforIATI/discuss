    <title>How to describe a &quot;management fee&quot;?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/how-to-describe-a-management-fee/454</link>
    <description>If an organisation - for a variety of reasons (and not the focus on this topic) - has a &quot;management fee&quot; for their work/project, how would they best describe this?  Is it a transaction of [type](http://iatistandard.org/202/codelists/TransactionType/) &quot;Expenditure&quot;?:

&gt; Outgoing funds that are spent on goods and services for the activity. The recipients of expenditures fall outside of IATI traceability standards.

Does that description / code cover a &quot;management fee&quot; type scenario?

Any examples out there?</description>

            <p>Thanks <a class="mention" href="/u/stevieflow">@stevieflow</a> for the question and <a class="mention" href="/u/yohannaloucheur">@YohannaLoucheur</a> for your comments above. Given the scenario that is described it looks as though three different options for how this could be handled have been identified?</p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t include any reference to the fee at all</li>
<li>The donor (Org B) could just publish it as an expense (referencing the Fund Manager Org A) as the recipient and as <a class="mention" href="/u/bill_anderson">@bill_anderson</a> describes</li>
<li>The donor (Org B) could include the fee in a disbursement to Org A. Org A defines the Incoming Funds but also include an Expenditure transaction (to themselves) to account for the ‘internal spend’ of the management fee</li>
</ol>
<p>I think of the three options, option 2 would be the one that I would prefer as I think it is the one that most closely describes what actually happens in the real world? However, other thoughts and comments are always welcome?</p>

            <p>Thanks for the clarification Steven</p>
<p>I don’t think this should be reported as an expenditure - it’s certainly not “an outlay of funds” by Org A, whichever way you look at it. It’s an expenditure for the upstream publisher/funder (Org B), and incoming funds for this one (Org A).</p>
<p>If they want to report it as a separate line of incoming funds, why not, but I’m not sure of the value of doing it.  In any chain of funder-implementer(s)-beneficiary, the total disbursements/expenditures at one stage won’t equal the incoming funds, since part of the funds will be used for admin costs (used in the broadest sense - offices, staff, phone lines etc).</p>

            <p>Thanks <a class="mention" href="/u/yohannaloucheur">@YohannaLoucheur</a></p>
<p>The use case I was exploring was towards the second scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li>Org A publishes</li>
<li>Org A act as the “fund manager” for a programme, directed by Donor B</li>
<li>Org A receives funds from Donor B,</li>
<li>Org A then disburse funds to multiple Implementing Orgs , who operate under this programme</li>
</ul>
<p>The “management fee” for Org A is related to managing this process/programme,  This could be described as IF (or E, as <a class="mention" href="/u/bill_anderson">@bill_anderson</a> describes)  - either would be better than not describing it, and requiring people to quantify the differences in values…</p>

            <p>Stever, you’re talking about the organization paying a management fee to their implementing partner, for instance?  So, perhaps they have an agremeent that Org A will deliver activities for a total of $400,000 and they agree to pay Org A an additional $25,000 as management fee?  Yes, that does sound like an expenditure.</p>
<p>Or is the publishing organisation receiving a management fee, as your initial question seems to imply? (“has a management fee for their project”) In that case it’s incoming funds, isn’t it?</p>

            <p>Can’t think of an example, but this is definitely expenditure and if you want to be completely accurate you  could use a transaction-level <a href="http://iatistandard.org/202/codelists/AidType/"> aid type</a> “G01” - "	Administrative costs not included elsewhere"</p>
