    <title>IATI Dashboard - metric on traceability does not include Incoming Commitments (or Pledges)</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/iati-dashboard-metric-on-traceability-does-not-include-incoming-commitments-or-pledges/1241</link>
    <description>Taking a look at the publishing statistics and the [specific metric on traceability](http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/comprehensiveness_financials.html#h_narrative):

&gt; For the data at the publishers&#39; lowest hierarchy, the percentage of current activities containing a transaction of type Incoming Funds that also contain the IATI identifier for the funding organisation&#39;s activity. 

and

&gt; All transactions of @type=IF (1.xx) or @type=1 (2.xx) must contain provider-org/@provider-activity-id

Should the inclusion of ``Incoming Funds`` be wider, to include ``Incoming Commitment`` and even ``Incoming Pledge`` ?  In theory, it&#39;s possible to include provider-org details, and link back to an existing activity, even when funds have not been disbursed.  Does that count as traceability?

Maybe there&#39;s a specific reason for just ``Incoming Funds`` though? 

--&gt; over to @bill_anderson , @Herman &amp; @pelleaardema ?</description>

            <p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/stevieflow">@stevieflow</a>,<br>
Agree, all incoming flows regardsless of the type, should be included in the traceability metrics.</p>

            <p>Thanks <a class="mention" href="/u/bill_anderson">@bill_anderson</a></p>
<p>Yes, of course can create a github issue.  One thing that made me hesitant is that the <a href="http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/comprehensiveness_financials.html#h_narrative" rel="nofollow noopener">text for the Commitments test</a> <strong>does</strong> include <code>Incoming Commitment</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the data in the chosen hierarchy, the percentage of all current activities that contain at least one transaction of type Commitment or Incoming Commitment</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyone able to check that the dashboard doesn’t <em>already</em> include <code>Incoming Commitment</code> in the traceability test, and it’s just a case of the text needed an update?  <a class="mention" href="/u/andylolz">@andylolz</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/dalepotter">@dalepotter</a>?</p>
<p>I guess as <code>Incoming Pledge</code> is brand new, that would needed adding anyway.</p>
