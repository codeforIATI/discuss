    <title>Organisation Type codelist - descriptions</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/organisation-type-codelist-descriptions/1268</link>
    <description>Continuing the discussion from [Organisation type codes - additions (included 2.03)](https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/organisation-type-codes-additions-included-2-03/858/18):

Does anyone still have a link to the definitions/descriptions of the new Org Type codes that were added in 2.03?  The description for &quot;Partner Country Based NGO&quot; currently published (http://iatistandard.org/203/codelists/OrganisationType/) has faulty logic: &quot;Partner country based NGO- NGOs not based in an aid recipient country and carrying out operations in one or more aid recipient countries.&quot;   I wonder if it&#39;s just a typo but cannot seem to find the original descriptions in the various 2.03 upgrade threads. 

Also, as was suggested early in the discussion about changing/adding Org Types, it would really be good to have descriptions for all elements of this codelist - ideally matching the DAC&#39;s where relevant.</description>
