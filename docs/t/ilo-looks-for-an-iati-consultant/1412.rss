    <title>ILO looks for an IATI consultant</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/ilo-looks-for-an-iati-consultant/1412</link>
    <description>Hello everyone, 

The International Labour Organization (a specialized UN agency based in Geneva) is IATI publisher and exploring ways to enhance our internal systems and compliance with the IATI standard. We are looking for IATI expertise to help us developing a roadmap that would be the result of tailored feasibility assessments and scenarios taking into account the ILO systems and context.

The assignment would most likely take place during autumn 2018. 

Would you be the person who could help us in our search for an experienced consultant in this area? I hope to hear from you here or by email (vanempel@ilo.org).

Many thanks!</description>
