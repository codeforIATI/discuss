            <p>Do you have any examples of the identifier numbers issued by the Ministry of Social Solidarity and Justice.</p>
<p>I can see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_NGO_Law" rel="nofollow noopener">evidence that organisations have to register with the Ministry of Social Solidarity</a> but I can’t find any information that shows MOSS maintain a register - only that they may reply with a letter of approval.</p>
