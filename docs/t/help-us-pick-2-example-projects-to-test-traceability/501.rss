    <title>Help us pick 2 example projects to test traceability</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/help-us-pick-2-example-projects-to-test-traceability/501</link>
    <description>Hi,

Two weeks ago @VincentVW and discussed joining forces to do some work on traceability (and it&#39;s close cousin, avoiding double counting). One of the approaches we will try is to work through some projects manually. The aim would be to try and figure out more clearly, where the issue is a data quality one, and where it is an issue of needed to adjust the standard.

To do this we need to find examples of projects which are &#39;as good as it gets&#39; e.g. which have two donors, and two implementers, all of whom are IATI publishers, and all of whom have good &#39;data quality&#39;.

Any suggestions?

Thanks,

Matt</description>

            <p>Hello <a class="mention" href="/u/matmaxgeds">@matmaxgeds</a>, we’d be interested in joining forces on this on the UK side - I’m sure we can find a project that will meet your requirements.</p>
<p>Have you seen the work on activity identifiers that <a class="mention" href="/u/rolfkleef">@rolfkleef</a> has been doing, published here: <a href="https://www.drostan.org" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.drostan.org</a>?</p>
