    <title>We&#39;ve changed email provider - let us know if you spot issues</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/weve-changed-email-provider-let-us-know-if-you-spot-issues/450</link>
    <description>About 10 days ago, the IATI Technical Team completed the switch of the email API that this forum requires to send all emails (topic and forum digests, password resets etc).

There should be no functional change from a user perspective. However, if users spot issues with email provision, please do let us know and we will be happy to investigate.

For those interested on a more technical level, we switched suppliers – from Mandrill to Mailgun – in light of the [previous supplier vastly increasing their charges](http://blog.discourse.org/2016/03/switching-your-discourse-from-mandrill-to-mailgun/).</description>
