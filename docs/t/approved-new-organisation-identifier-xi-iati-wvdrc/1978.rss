    <title>[Approved]New Organisation Identifier: XI-IATI-WVDRC</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/approved-new-organisation-identifier-xi-iati-wvdrc/1978</link>
    <description>The following addition to the IATI Organisation Identifier list has been proposed for World Vision&#39;s DRC Office. 

Due to their publishing time-frame and that there are currently [no registrars which offer stable identifiers in DRC](https://github.com/org-id/register/issues/292), the XI-IATI identifier has been pursued.

**Code:**  XI-IATI-WVDRC
**Name:** World Vision DRC
**Description:**  Our teams have been working in the DRC since 1984. Today, we are working to contribute to the measurable and sustainable improvement of well-being for 5,311,208 children and their communities through transformational development and humanitarian relief programmes focused on: health and nutrition, education, water and sanitation, protecting children, livelihoods and resilience, food aid, psychosocial support and the reintegration if displaced people.
**URL:**  https://www.wvi.org/congo-drc/about-us

If no objection is received this XI-IATI code will be approved and added in a week.</description>
