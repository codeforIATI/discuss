    <title>CIOs in your organisations</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/cios-in-your-organisations/613</link>
    <description>In DFID we have a new CIO (Chief Information Officer), Adrian Blundell.

Adrian worked on the precursor to IATI way back pre-2008 (anyone remember IDML?), along with Simon Parrish, but has been working in Zambia and in our HR/GroupOps teams since then.

Adrian would like to connect with people in similar CIO/CTO/CDO roles in other organisations, not just bilateral donors but also NGOs, foundations, private sector and multilateral. 

Would you help by either posting a contact on the bottom of this thread, or by dropping me an email.

Thanks :slight_smile:</description>
