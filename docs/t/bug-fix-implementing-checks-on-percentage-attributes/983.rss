    <title>Bug fix: Implementing checks on @percentage attributes</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/bug-fix-implementing-checks-on-percentage-attributes/983</link>
    <description>Linked to the proposal in the v2.03 upgrade to set [boundary values where the IATI Standard refers to percentages](https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/boundary-values-for-percentages-included-2-03/843), a [pull request](https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Schemas/pull/329) has been received by @VincentVW to restrict values used in percentage attributes to the set boundaries (0 - 100). 

This change would apply to the following attributes:

- `iati-activities/iati-activity/recipient-country/@percentage`
- `iati-activities/iati-activity/recipient-region/@percentage`
- `iati-activities/iati-activity/sector/@percentage`
- `iati-activities/iati-activity/capital-spend/@percentage`
- `iati-activities/iati-activity/country-budget-items/budget-item/@percentage`

The IATI Technical Team are considering this to be a bug fix, given that the definition for these attributes typically reads 

&gt; Content must be a positive decimal number between 0 and 100, with no percentage sign.

Therefore, and **unless an objection is received we plan to implement this pull request for version 2.02 of the Activity Standard after a one week notice period (expiring on Sunday 13 August 2017)**.  Where appropriate, this will also be back-ported to prior versions.</description>

            <p>Just to follow up here: I raised the following (temporary) objection to this <a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Schemas/pull/329#issuecomment-320333141">over on github</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I do love this update… But… I think it might be better to wait on this until the <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/boundary-values-for-percentages-included-2-03/843">boundary values for percentages</a> proposal is done and dusted.</p>
<p>That proposal acknowledges that the typical definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Content must be a positive decimal number between 0 and 100, with no percentage sign.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>…suggests zero should be <em>excluded</em> since it isn’t a positive number. And <a class="mention" href="/u/wendy">@wendy</a> <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/boundary-values-for-percentages-included-2-03/843/4">points out</a> that in at least some contexts, excluding zero might be preferable anyway. So adding this now seems like it might add more confusion, not less.</p>
