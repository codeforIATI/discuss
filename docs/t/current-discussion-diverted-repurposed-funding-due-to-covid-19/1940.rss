    <title>Current Discussion: Diverted / repurposed funding due to COVID-19</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/current-discussion-diverted-repurposed-funding-due-to-covid-19/1940</link>
    <description>A number of funds and activities are being turned fully or partially into COVID-19 activities. How should these changes be reflected in IATI data? How should activities and transactions be identified? Activities could be split into COVID-19 and non COVID-19 components.

This could look like:

* Cancelling existing activities and creating two new ones. Helps to easily identify COVID-19 activities 

* Showing a removal of funds from existing activities and setting up a new COVID-19 one
* Keeping the one activity but adding new classifications to show the percentage split between COVID-19 and non COVID-19 

Options depend on how an organisation’s business models and internal systems work. But to track the redirection in funding options include:

* Adding ‘redirected’ into activity titles and descriptions.

* Using the sector element to show percentage splits.

* Using outgoing and incoming funds, with a COVID-19 description to show the redirection of funds.
