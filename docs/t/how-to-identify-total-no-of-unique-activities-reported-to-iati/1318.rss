    <title>How to identify total no. of unique activities reported to IATI?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/how-to-identify-total-no-of-unique-activities-reported-to-iati/1318</link>
    <description>Dear IATI community, 
I&#39;m performing an analysis of the IATI dataset reported by 23 EU publishers, and I was wondering if there is a way **how to extract full list of UNIQUE iati-identifiers (without duplicates) in order to identify a total no. of UNIQUE activities reported to IATI**. 

I&#39;ve noticed that IATI dashboard provides an information how many times iati-identifier (unique activity ID) has been used. However, as the same iati-identifier can appear multiple times in different XML files, **the IATI dashboard just sums up all iati-identifiers used in the publisher&#39;s dataset and does not show a total no. of unique iati-activities reported.** 

Giving Romanian dataset as an example, 
Romanian ODA 2014 - 2016 XML contains 670 unique activities
Romanian ODA 2014-2015 XML contains 430 unique activities, 
however iati-identifier XM-DAC-77-2014000001 appears in both XML. **How can I therefore identify a total number of unique activities  reported in the whole Romanian dataset?**

I would really appreciate any comments or suggestions.
Regards,
