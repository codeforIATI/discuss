    <title>Reporting from MS Dynamics CRM to IATI</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/reporting-from-ms-dynamics-crm-to-iati/499</link>
    <description>Broederlijk Delen, a Belgian NGO, is setting up an Aid Information Management System for the administrative and financial monitoring of programmes, projects and partner organisations in the Global South and to organise information regarding Monitoring and Evaluation. One of the goals for this system is to facilitate the publication of IATI data. 

We have chosen **Microsoft Dynamics CRM** to build our Aid Information Management System. We plan to work via CSV to IATI for the publication of IATI data.

Are their organisations in this discussion forum that are already using Microsoft Dynamics CRM to report their IATI data? We are interested in exchanging best practices.</description>

            <p>I don’t know if ICCO is on this forum, I think Martijn Marijnis there is overseeing their IATI export from Dynamics. See their portal <a href="http://portal.icco.nl/explore" rel="nofollow noopener">http://portal.icco.nl/explore</a></p>
