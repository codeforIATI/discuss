    <title>Session Proposal at TAG</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/session-proposal-at-tag/1503</link>
    <description>Hi, in light of collaboration, we (ZZ) have submitted a draft proposal for TAG (had to to cut off on the Typeform space form, jeez that&#39;s really tight!). We would like to facilitate a workshop on the impact of data visualisation and how it [changed aid development perception in any way?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1erV4E9vhNxCi7OKp6QXsymcRCUAvRh1ztPlRBr-3ctw/edit?usp=sharing) 

This is a first draft and may change over time, but perhaps other interested in co-facilitating this? Would be interested to learn how 10 years of IATI and data visualisation has shaped the initiative in its own way.

Any input &amp; feedback appreciated. 

(ps: also very much looking forward to open space sessions btw. It that would require ZZ not having a 90 minute slot for a workshop, than that would be just fine!)</description>
