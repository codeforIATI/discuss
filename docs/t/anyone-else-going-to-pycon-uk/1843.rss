    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/anyone-else-going-to-pycon-uk/1843</link>
    <description>I&#39;m going to PyCon UK this weekend (a conference about the Python programming language). Is anyone else in the IATI community going? (Sorry tickets have now sold out.) I know there have been a few of us in previous years.</description>
