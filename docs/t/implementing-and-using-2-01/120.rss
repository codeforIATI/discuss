    <title>Implementing and using 2.01</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/implementing-and-using-2-01/120</link>
    <description>I&#39;d be interested to hear experiences from people who have either produced or are using 2.01 data. Maybe you&#39;re a data publisher who has adapted your systems to produce 2.01, so please tell us what you had to change. Or maybe you&#39;re a data consumer who has had to adapt your app to pull in 2.01 data, so how did you do that?</description>
