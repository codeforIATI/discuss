    <description>Dear all, we would be delighted if any IATI developer would be interested to use the datasets from the European Commission or Investment Bank in this event. We could assist in discussing ideas if needed.

**EU Datathon 2017**

Can you re-use open data to promote innovative services? Can you solve other societal challenges using it? Can you create mobile or web apps using open data from different information sources? If yes, #EUdatathon2017 is for you!

This first datathon of its kind promotes re-use of #EUopendata from the EU Open Data Portal, the central access point to open data made available by the EU institutions, agencies and bodies.

Data teams will be able to demonstrate how open data from public institutions can be used to address specific policy or societal challenges and promote innovative services, reflecting certain priorities of the Juncker Commission.

Register your team and make a proposal for an app by 8 October. If your idea is preselected, you&#39;ll have 4 weeks until 12 November to develop your idea! Winners will be selected on 16 November during an event in Brussels. Not wanting to hack but simply curious? Just register to attend the event on 16 November.

More information about prizes will follow, but the winning team will have the chance to present their project at the European Big Data Value Forum in Versailles, on 21-23 November 2017, with travel and accommodation expenses paid.

The datathon is being organised by the Estonian Presidency of the Council of the European Union together with the Publications Office of the European Union.
