        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I’ve not managed to locate an example of an identifier issued by ‘Securities and Exchange Commission Philippines’. Have you any example IDs?</p>
<p>From what I can find, the search service only allows you to find register names, not numbers.</p>
<p>Open Corporates look at the <a href="http://www.business.gov.ph/web/guest/bn-search" rel="nofollow noopener">Philippine Business Registry</a> as their potential source of company registration, but note that this does not appear to issue a company registration number. Both the PBR and SEC search services are searches on names, not numbers.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipilipinas.org/index.php/Philippines_Business_Registry" rel="nofollow noopener">This source</a> suggests there may have been a project to create a Philippine Business Number, but I can’t find any other mentions of this, and other <a href="http://business.inquirer.net/50595/business-registration-in-philippines-now-made-easier" rel="nofollow noopener">documentation on business registration in the Philippines</a> suggests that a certificate of business name is issued, but not a number.</p>
<p>If the research above is correct, this gives us a few options:</p>
<p>(1) Rule out PH-SEC as an identifier, as there is no clear value to suffix onto it;</p>
<p>(2) Propose a replacement pattern for converting registered names into identifiers</p>
<p>If may be that the certificates issued to companies <strong>do</strong> include a number - but we would need to provide people with clear guidance on how to get hold of this.</p>
