    <title>New Reports on the Data Needs of Organizations in the Agriculture/FS Sector</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/new-reports-on-the-data-needs-of-organizations-in-the-agriculture-fs-sector/549</link>
    <description>To complement our [analysis of the agricultural investment data landscape](http://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/agricultural-investment-data-landscape-analysis-report/463/2), the Initiative for Open Ag Funding undertook consultations with donors, NGOs, and foundations to understand what data organizations working in the agriculture and food security sector actually need.  The initiative recently released short (just 6 pages!) reports detailing the findings of those consultations.
 
We found that organizations across the development community do need better investment data for a variety of reasons, all of which are rooted in increasing the effectiveness of their resources. We also identified a number of challenges that organizations face in accessing and using data. We are currently using these insights to inform our proposal for how IATI data can be improved, and how the IATI standard might need to change to make it more relevant to this sector. 

The full reports are listed below: 

* [Agriculture Investment Data Needs: Synthesis Report](https://www.interaction.org/document/agriculture-investment-data-needs-%E2%80%93-synthesis-report) 
* [Agriculture Investment Data Needs: NGOs](https://www.interaction.org/sites/default/files/Agriculture%20Investment%20Data%20Needs.%20NGOs.pdf)
* [Agriculture Investment Data Needs: Donors](https://www.interaction.org/sites/default/files/Agriculture%20Investment%20Data%20Needs.%20Donors.pdf)
* [Agriculture Investment Data Needs: Foundations](https://www.interaction.org/sites/default/files/Agriculture%20Investment%20Data%20Needs.%20Foundations.pdf)
