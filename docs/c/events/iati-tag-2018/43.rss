            <p>Dear All<br>
Last week we posted information about the TAG Chair election with a fairly short deadline for nominations - the end of this week (November 2nd) to give us time to circulate nominations, and for everybody going to Nepal to think about who they will vote for. Please take a look at the information on the website and send your nomination (or self-nomination) through to me this week.<br>

Thanks very much,<br>

            <p>Maybe I missed a topic, but I was wondering what the process will be for electing a new TAG chair. Some questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How will candidates be selected?</li>
<li>When and how will candidates present themselves (do we have time to reflect a little bit)?</li>
<li>Who will be able to vote?</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Allowing IATI-data to constitute a resilient, growing web of data and information, we must allow organisational links to be initiated from any point. This means that any IATI-reporting partner should be expected to identify partner-organisations by means of the valid IATI-method (pinpointing legal entities) regardless of any decision on the side of that partner – whether the partner is reporting or not, or using that excact org_id as IATI-identifier or not.</p>
<p>In order for this to happen, and work to our advantage, any IATI-reporting organisation should publish information on any ‘legal entity’ they represent. For each of these legal entities, it must furthermore be registered whether they are IATI-reporting on their own, or forms part of the data published under the overarching organisational entity.</p>
<p>This will allow the data-web to be tied, constructed, from any point of departure, whether or not the partner with the ‘Funding role’ is reporting in IATI-format – or is reporting under another identity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it will allow larger organisations to delegate reporting responsibilities to e.g. ‘country offices’ that are, anyways, responsible for data and data quality-issues, as long as these offices are legal entities, without losing out on the recognition of the unity of the ‘global’ organisation.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, it would also constitute a more robust Master Data Management approach, and allow for easier transitions in the future – compared to the quite cumbersome, current instruction on how to label all elements in the activity-file, in case a reporting org_id is changed.</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>We are thinking about the key themes we want to cover at the upcoming TAG2018 in Kathmandu in October/November this year.</p>
<p>I’ve written a <a class="attachment" href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/original/1X/8e06ea28a681766001e43c30ebf2b3a53278254f.pdf">short note</a> with a few ideas but I’d love to hear ideas from the TAG community.</p>
<p>In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>What themes would be particularly relevant to Nepal?</li>
<li>How could we have attendees leaving the TAG with surprise and delight at how IATI can help address their needs?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Please refer to the <a href="https://iatistandard.org/documents/658/IATI_TAG_2018_meeting_proposal.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">new meeting proposal</a> for the annual Technical Advisory Group (TAG) meeting which is being planned for 13-15 November 2018 in Nepal. Please provide your feedback by responding to this Discuss thread.</p>
