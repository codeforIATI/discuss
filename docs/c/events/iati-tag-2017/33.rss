<ul>
<li>As the comment handler is not great in Google Sheets could you restrict comments on the sheet to minor points. Can you address any major issues by replying to this topic.</li>
<li>We have another version of this with a more detailed record of named comments which we thought it would be better to hold back for reference as it makes the proceedings as a whole difficult to follow.</li>
<li>The sheet follows the order of slides used on the day.</li>
<li>Rows are shaded to group multiple slides addressing a single issue.</li>
<li>All issues have been categorised with one of four outcomes: Accept; Reject; Consult further; or None. (Accept/Reject refer, of course, to consensus, and not formal decisions)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Technical Team is meeting next week to plan next steps on consultations for Version 2.03 and issues that need to go to the Members Assembly in June. We will do our best to ensure coherence and continuity in ongoing discussions.</p>

            <p>I hope this doesn’t cause too much disruption, but …</p>
<p>By labeling day 4 of the TAG as a Technical Consultation we have mistakenly created the impression that Days 2 and 3 are non-technical. The agenda on these days is as varied as the TAG has always been - including technical sessions (of both soft and hard varieties).</p>
<p>The addition of Day 4 was to work at reaching specific consensus on outstanding issues relating to the standard and associated rules and guidelines.</p>
<p>So I hope calling Day 4 “Standards Day” will trip off the tongue and the brain more easily.</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Most bottom-up humanitarian activity reports from the field (3Ws: Who, What, Where) arrive in spreadsheet format; many people who want to use IATI data and combine it with other humanitarian data also need to work with tabular formats.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://hxlstandard.org" rel="nofollow noopener">Humanitarian Exchange Language</a> can serve as a bridge in both directions, making it easier to import spreadsheet-type data into the IATI ecosystem, and making it easier to pull IATI data back out for integration into the humanitarian field-data ecosystem.</p>
<p>Possible topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Topic in a policy-level humanitarian-data panel discussion (together with FTS and the Grand Bargain), focusing on bottom-up field reporting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mid-level presentation on existing humanitarian 3Ws, similarities and gaps related to IATI activity reports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evening tech hands-on workshop tagging real 3W spreadsheets and converting them to IATI.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Cheers, David</p>

          <title>TAG meeting postponed until 2017</title>

            <p>We’re sorry to let you know that the TAG 2016 will be postponed until early next year. We apologise to those who were planning to attend and for any inconvenience caused.</p>
<p>Over the last few months, the IATI Secretariat had been preparing for this year’s TAG to be held in Addis Ababa. However, this week the Ethiopian government declared a state of emergency for the next six months. After much consideration, the Secretariat, TAG Chair and IATI Governing Board agreed it was sensible to avoid the possibility of cancelling nearer to the date of the event and decided to postpone the meeting until early 2017.</p>
<p>We are currently looking for an alternative location and will confirm the details shortly. In the meantime, you can still get involved with preparations:</p>
<p><strong>Run a session at the TAG - deadline extended</strong><br>
We have extended the deadline to submit proposals to run a session at the TAG meeting to <strong>Friday 25 November</strong>. We encourage you come forward to share new ideas and projects with the IATI community, or discuss a burning issue that needs exploring. Please <a href="http://mailto:tag@iatistandard.org">get in touch</a> if you want to discuss a TAG session idea with us.</p>
<p>We will continue to update you with further announcements, along with TAG discussion topics from IATI’s Technical Team.</p>
<p>Once again, we’re sorry for any inconvenience caused and look forward to seeing you early next year.</p>

          <category>IATI TAG 2017</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>On the <a href="//discuss.iatistandard.org/t/tag-2016-exciting-news/532">fourth day of the TAG</a> (Thursday 9th March) we will be holding an all-day working session for the secretariat’s Technical Team to collaborate with the growing number of IATI experts in the community in progressing improvements to the standard as well as associated rules and guidelines.</p>
<p>We will work to a formal agenda and minutes will be taken. Papers covering all issues to be discussed will be prepared and published well in advance. The meeting will be co-chaired by John Adams as TAG Chair and myself as Technical Lead. We will attempt to reach consensus wherever possible.</p>
<p><strong>Agenda</strong></p>
<p>The agenda will be restricted to proposals that relate directly to specific changes to the standard or associated rules and guidelines. For example, fixing the result element to accurately deal with aggregation and disaggregation is on the agenda. Discussion on how results reporting should be improved in general is not – but will no doubt be a key issue in the TAG proper on day 2 or 3.</p>
<p><a href="//discuss.iatistandard.org/t/tag-tech-consult-outline-agenda/534">A <strong>proposed draft agenda</strong> can be found here</a>. Everyone is welcome to add to this agenda provided that the item contains a specific proposal and can be supported by written argument to be shared with the community on this forum.</p>
<p>It will be possible to add matters arising during the first two days of the TAG into the agenda, provided that they are presented as concrete, actionable proposals.</p>
<p>The agenda is already quite full. If we need to trim, we will do so as transparently as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Participation</strong></p>
<p>There is no restriction on attendance provided you inform us in advance so that we know how many to cater for. HOWEVER, all discussions will be technical and will assume that you have a good working knowledge of the standard and its implementation. Novices are welcome to attend as observers, but no attempt will be made to explain matters to you.</p>
<p><strong>Outcomes</strong></p>
<p>Our work should lead to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The content for the Version 2.03 decimal upgrade. Formal work on this will begin immediately after the TAG and should go live by the end of the first quarter of 2017.</li>
<li>The clarification and definition of some key rules and guidelines that cannot be enforced by the schema.</li>
<li>The earmarking of certain proposals for Version 3.01 integer upgrade (for which there is still no planned date) and consensus to drop some items that have been proposed over the past years, but have never ‘made the grade’.</li>
</ul>

          <category>IATI TAG 2017</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The IATI Secretariat and Tech Team have been busy planning the next TAG meeting and we have some exciting news to share:</p>
<p><strong>Date and location</strong><br>
The next TAG will take place in late November / early December this year in Eastern Africa. We will confirm both the exact dates and location as soon as we can.</p>
<p><strong>Format</strong><br>
This TAG will be spread over three days:</p>
<ul>
<li>Day 1: <a href="//discuss.iatistandard.org/t/technical-consultation-workshop/533/1"><strong>Technical Consultation Workshop</strong></a> - an opportunity for IATI ‘super users’ to come together to resolve in detail some of the thornier issues we all encounter (double counting and traceability, for example) and work collaboratively towards establishing firm rules or guidelines for the community.</li>
<li>Days 2 &amp; 3: A mixture of workshops, marketplaces and plenary sessions pitched at different audiences.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consultation</strong><br>
In preparation for the Technical Consultation Workshop, we will be posting consultation papers on a selection of topics over the coming weeks and asking you to share your thoughts and ideas so we can go into the workshop with a clear sense of where there is consensus and where we still need to do some more work.</p>
<p><strong>Call for session proposals</strong><br>
We’d like to make sure the agenda for Days 2 and 3 reflects your interests as much as possible, so we’ll be asking for ideas from the community for sessions on particular topics. Look out for the call for proposals over the next few weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Marketplace</strong><br>
The TAG is always a great opportunity to learn more about new (and old) initiatives, tools and ideas. However, we think ‘show and tell’ isn’t enough - we’d like to hear a call to action too. What could change as a result of people joining your initiative? How would using a new tool move things away from business as usual? So we’ll be asking you to ‘sell’ your stall with a lightning talk.</p>
<p>Do keep an eye on Discuss over the coming weeks as we post more information and ask for your input.</p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing you all later this year for another great TAG meeting!</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>
<p>Joni</p>
<p>(IATI Lead, Development Initiatives)</p>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I think I can be brief about this; are there any plans for an IATI TAG meeting in 2016 yet? Or maybe a timeframe / location where it’ll approximately be?</p>
<p>Thanks :)!</p>
<p>Kind regards,<br>
Kasper</p>
