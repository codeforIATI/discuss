          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/siemvaessen">@siemvaessen</a> do you currently have a timescale for when OIPA will provide <a href="http://docs.oipa.nl/en/latest/parser/#supported-iati-versions-in-the-parser">full support for v2.03</a> of the IATI Standard? For work under the ‘Grand Bargain’ we are looking at using some of the v2.03 features and it would be great if any new capability could use OIPA as required? TIA</p>

          <title>Registry API Schema Error Since October &#39;16 Update</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Robert]]></dc:creator>
          <category>APIs</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I’ve encountered a schema error (“key already exists”) stemming from the “Extras” hash when attempting to create or update datasets via the Registry API.  My code had been working for these actions prior to the recent API update in October.</p>
<p>Folks from IATI support (and CKAN) have been notified and are looking into it; however in the meantime, I wondered if anyone else in the API user community uses the “extras” hash when adding or updating datasets, and if so whether you have encountered any similar hiccups.  If anyone is using that section and it’s working, I’d love to hear from you!</p>
<p>Regards -<br>
Robert</p>

          <title>Thoughts about API needs for DevTracker</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/siemvaessen">@siemvaessen</a> As we discussed earlier, I’ve added some thoughts on what DevTracker would need to have as an aggregate API  to drive 1) country pages and 2) hierarchical projects. I can probably break these down further into appropriate JSON-type structures, but will give you an idea of some of the challenges.</p>

<p>Why would we want to discuss an API standard, and what would we want out of this?</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/johnadams">@JohnAdams</a> talks about an “API contract” - in terms of activity (and further down the line. aggregate) calls being constructed in a common way - regardless of the source/base.  This then enables the “consumer” to make a choice on which API to utilise</p>

            <p>Hi All</p>
<p>I’ve no idea if this will work (if it doesn’t, Ill blame <a class="mention" href="/u/adrian">@Adrian</a> !) , but it’s worth a go , and might help test/understand a function of the Discourse platform</p>
<p>(It may be far easier to have a plain ole Poll - but bear with me!)</p>
<p>So - to try and schedule a regular API Working Group call, Ill post a few options as responses to this thread.  If you can vote on your preferred option we can take it from there.  Vote through clicking the heart-shaped icon underneath the relevant post.</p>
<p>The intention would be to start these calls from September.  Any call should be one hour, as a maximum.</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>In March I shared some thoughts via a <a href="https://gist.github.com/kouphax/f5f3553c1c48860288bc" rel="nofollow noopener">Gist</a> about some ways in which IATI data could be used in a way that would make it more accessible to NGOs and other parties.  I have been asked to move the content of the <a href="https://gist.github.com/kouphax/f5f3553c1c48860288bc" rel="nofollow noopener">gist</a> here as it is a better forum (in that it is actually a forum) for discussing it.</p>
<p>I must caveat the following with</p>
<ol>
<li>These are just ideas off the top of my head and could be further refined.</li>
<li>I currently don’t work with IATI data or projects so the <strong>user need</strong> associated with these ideas may be very limited</li>
<li>This was written roughly in a single pass and might contain terrible atrocities against grammar and spelling.  I apologies for that.</li>
<li>I am in no way saying any of this is right or anything currently existing is wrong, these are just thoughts that may or may not spark some discussion.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>EARLY ALPHA: Some very early unvalidated thoughts on an IATI API Service/Playground.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There appears, from an outside view, to be an attempt to create a unified IATI API that will supoprt querying of all available IATI data in a unified way.  Projects like <a href="http://iati-datastore.herokuapp.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">IATI Datastore</a> and to a certain extent the <a href="http://devtracker.dfid.gov.uk/api" rel="nofollow noopener">DevTracker API</a> <em>[There are more and we should call them out here]</em> have gone some way to achieving this goal.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h2>DevTracker</h2>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>During the development of <a href="http://devtracker.dfid.gov.uk/" rel="nofollow noopener">DevTracker</a> we explored using various IATI datastores but every one of them had constraints.  Some problematic, others potentially catastrophic to the project.  Existing solutions either strictly adhered to the IATI standard thus refusing to consume most of the necessary data (IATI Datastore) or had assumptions baked into the logic that conflicted with the DFID data structure.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h2>Root Cause Analysis</h2>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The reason for these problems was that existing datastores attempt to provide a generic appraoch to a non-generic problem.  While most API based solutions give people access to Activity streams and Organistaion streams there simply isn’t enough guidence within the developing IATI standard yet to expand on this.  Consumers needs are typically rather unique to them in some regard which imposes certain overheads on a generic API.  In DevTracker for example using an existing solution would have meant extracting data by crawling the, often paged, endpoints, deserialing it and aggreating the data into our own structure that we want to consume.  This would have been more time consuming and prone to error.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The other problem was that most of these solutions aren’t open to extension without diving into the code itself.  Something that many people would consider too high a barrier of entry.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h2>Suggestion</h2>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Two things I have observed (from my outsider view) is that people want</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Access to data (or subset of)</li>
<li>Ability to construct their own queries over this data</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>These people may want to build a site, make an API of a subset of data publically available, or simply do some spreadsheet based work.  All of these require some very specific query abilities and custom outputs that dont belong in a generic solution.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the last few weeks I’ve been toying with the idea of an “API as a Service” and/or “Data Playground”.  Both of these could be seen as an extension to <a href="http://iati-datastore.herokuapp.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">IATI Datastore</a> (though an extensible approach would be more favourable due to the needs of some users).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h3>API as a Service</h3>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This concept revolves around providing a multi-tenant approach to providing an API.  A user would sign up to the service, configure their resources (select desired data sources, refresh frequency etc) and immediatley be given access to a basic but full featured API similar to the IATI Datastore.  They can then provide their own aggregations to the API e.g. Country View, Sectors etc. which will be exposed as an API endpoint on their specific API e.g. <code>http://jhughes.iati-api.org/api/countries</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Custom queries can be provided through some sort of query language <em>[TBD]</em> e.g. Readonly SQL Subset, Readonly XPath/XQuery or some sort of graphical interface akin to <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/" rel="nofollow noopener">Yahoo Pipes</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Varous other customisations <em>could</em> be provided if there was a need (i18n of API data, custom codelists etc.) but the goal should be to provide flexability without inventing an entirely new platfrom with a million bells and whistles.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h3>Data Playground</h3>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Not everyone wants an API.  Some users may simply want to access a subset of data and play around with it to perform some adhoc calculations or embed it as a widget in another site.  So where the API as a Service feature would be too full blown they could use the Data Playground.  Inspired by Githubs <a href="https://gist.github.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Gist</a> feature (providing ability to share code without having to use a full blown git repository) and Neo4Js <a href="http://gist.neo4j.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">Graph Gist</a> (abiltiy to save and visualise graph queries) the playground would enable users to write and save one off queries against a set of data.  Results would come back in table, csv, json, xml, graphs (D3 powered for example) and can be embedded in other sites or exported to spreadsheets and other tools.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Again format of the queries is open to discussion.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h2>Thoughts</h2>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h3>Extensible Data Store</h3>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Datastores could be pluggable (assuming a common defined interface) so you could provide a public store and plug it into your own API platform account.  Or other people coudl provide BaseX version of IATI or you could run everything locally etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h3>Monetisation</h3>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As the IATI dataset grows and potential userbase gets larger the cost of running this type service would also increase.  Queries would not necesarilly be cheap (though extensive caching in line with IATI data refresh would help).  So a tiered subscription model could be introduced giving access to various features or increasing numbers of Requests/Queries per Month.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h3>Benefits</h3>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>For the User/Consumer</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>They aren’t obliged to download and setup another product or technology stack just to get some data.</li>
<li>They don’t have to work around the constraints of a sytem designed to cater to everyone</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>For the API Designers</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>They can look at providing a baseline API (performance, scale, API semantics) without extensive aggregations and trying to guess people needs.</li>
</ul>

          <title>How do we document an API standard?</title>

          <category>APIs</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>We’ve talked briefly about ways and means to document an API standard, whilst also being minded that we should collectively build something to discuss/test in this early stage.</p>
<p>I was pointed towards <a href="https://helloreverb.com/developers/swagger" rel="nofollow noopener">Swagger</a> recently -  to help document an API (but maybe not an API Standard), so just wanted to share on the list.  I’m sure there are others that exist.  One limitation I can envisage is that such tools document an API with a base URL - whereas an API standard documents common/agreed methods for API calls, etc.</p>
<p>I know <a class="mention" href="/u/adrian">@Adrian</a> was also interested in looking at ways to document, and I’m pretty sure <a class="mention" href="/u/bjwebb">@bjwebb</a> has thoughts.</p>

          <title>CSV API Guidlines</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[bjwebb]]></dc:creator>
          <category>APIs</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>It occurs to me that we should maybe have some general guidelines for working with/producing CSVs. Currently the IATI Datastore, Dashboard, Codelist API, the Registry and the CSV Conversion tool linked to from the registry produce csvs. The Registry, CSV2IATI and AidStream also accept CSVs as inputs. If I have missed any active CSV producing/consuming IATI tools/APIs, please post them below.</p>
<p>Guidlines might include might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>What format should be used (ie. what should the separator be, and what type of escaping should be used)</li>
<li>How should new lines be treated (the behaviour of quoted new lines seems to vary a lot)</li>
<li>What encoding should be used (I would suggest UTF-8)</li>
</ul>
<p>If these choices are consistent between multiple APIs, then they can share one piece of user guidance (ie. How to open this file in your spreadsheet program of choice). The most common user mistake I see is opening UTF-8 encoded files as windows code page.</p>

            <p>We should maintain a list of all the IATI related APIs somewhere, possibly with a list of relevant contacts, and whether the developers are involved in this working group.</p>
<p>I’ve turned this post into a discourse “wiki post”, so hopefully anyone should be able to edit and add links as appropriate. It’s still part of the forum though, so if you prefer you can reply with a comment instead.</p>
<h1>List of APIs</h1>

<h1>Comparison of APIs</h1>
<p>We should probably have a full “feature matrix” to compare APIs.</p>
<p>For now, <a class="mention" href="/u/stevieflow">@stevieflow</a> has been doing some work comparing the number of activities in different APIs - <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AqXcKmXbCG-OdGN2NnBHa0NqY0JEbjhSaURaWWtCaXc&amp;usp=drive_web#gid=0" rel="nofollow noopener">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AqXcKmXbCG-OdGN2NnBHa0NqY0JEbjhSaURaWWtCaXc&amp;usp=drive_web#gid=0</a></p>

          <title>About the APIs Working Group</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[stevieflow]]></dc:creator>
          <category>APIs</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br>
This working group is a continuation of the previous work at <a href="http://wiki.iatistandard.org/wg/api/start" rel="nofollow noopener">http://wiki.iatistandard.org/wg/api/start</a></p>
<p>At the TAG meeting in Montreal, one of the sessions discussed the overall architecture of tools that have been built on IATI data. The tools (OIPA, DevTracker, d-Portal, Sida etc) all appear to have a similar overall architecture:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web presentation front-end</li>
<li>API layer</li>
<li>Data repository (SQL or noSQL database) including import from IATI Registry.</li>
</ul>
<p>This working group exists to further develop an IATI API Standard or Convention that can be used by implementers. Having a common API standard will properly decouple the presentation and data layers<br>
enabling implementers to concentrate on building the best presentation or data layer they an.</p>
<p><strong>OBJECTIVES</strong><br>
Seek agreement on whether an API Convention is a desirable thing.</p>
<p>A shared IATI API convention</p>
<p>Work on APIs including:</p>
<ul>
<li>IATI API Convention (current google doc)</li>
<li>Customisable queries for the API</li>
<li>Linked Data representation of IATI data (SPARQL)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>DELIVERABLES</strong><br>
Updated API Convention document including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Activity API</li>
<li>Organisation API</li>
<li>Aggregate API</li>
</ul>
<p>Schemas describing XML/JSON responses<br>
Comparison table of current APIs to the updated convention document<br>
Standards on how to construct APIs for different purposes.<br>
Reference implementations for the API<br>
Description of upgrade process/change control process for APIs</p>
<p><strong>TIMESCALE</strong><br>
The API Working Group will operate until the members of the group decide that there is no longer a requirement for the group to exist (Maybe this could timebound to some deliverables)</p>
<p><strong>MEMBERSHIP</strong><br>
The group should be open to anyone TAG member to participate and contribute.</p>
<p><strong>MEETINGS</strong><br>
The primary means of communication for the working group will be a mailing list (or Discourse).Skype? Do we want to set some regular meeting dates/frequencies?</p>
<p><strong>ACCOUNTABILITY</strong><br>
The group is accountable to the wider IATI TAG and will report back to the IATI TAG through the IATI TAG Newsletter and at the annual IATI TAG Meeting.</p>
