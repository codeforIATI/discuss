          <title>Publisher ID issue</title>

            <p>Dear reader,</p>
<p>I have been including transactions for my organization into AIDstream. I tried to publish our data to IATI but I repeatedly receive a pop-up warning that our publisher ID (under registry information) was not correct. However, I don’t understand which publisher ID should be placed, because our IATI publisher ID is somehow not valid.</p>
<p>If anyone can help me in this issue, I look very much forward to your reply. The AIDstream support desk was unfortunately not of any help.</p>
<p>Warm regards from the Netherlands,<br>
Naomi</p>

          <title>Region codelist is out-of-date (from OECD DAC source)</title>

            <p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/iati-techteam">@IATI-techteam</a></p>
<p>The Region codelist seems out-of-date with the OECD DAC source.  There seem to be <a href="https://codelists.codeforiati.org/Region/" rel="nofollow noopener">nine new regional codes available</a>, which might be useful to publishers.</p>
<p>I can see that the <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/making-codelists-more-accessible/1895">community-run codelist</a> was updated on <a href="https://github.com/codeforIATI/IATI-Codelists-NonEmbedded/commits/master/xml/Region.xml" rel="nofollow noopener">13th April</a>, as the codelist “bot” identified an update to the OECD DAC source.</p>
<p>It’d be great to know the timescales for the central IATI documentation to follow this.  I had understood similar automations were already in place.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

          <title>IATI Working Group &amp; Community of Practice: COVID-19?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[stevieflow]]></dc:creator>
          <category>IATI Standard</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>It’s great to see so much discussion and activity within the community in terms of how COVID-19 relates to the IATI standard</p>
<p>Once again, many thanks to the <a class="mention" href="/u/iati-techteam">@IATI-techteam</a> for acting so quickly and efficiently to provide initial guidance and support to the community.</p>
<p>We now seem to have a groundswell of activity and action, along with a fair number of challenges and considerations.  A lot of these are detailed in Discuss threads, but also in other discussions, webinars and non-digital channels (aka people talking to each other!).</p>
<p>Back in September 2019, at the <a href="https://iatistandard.org/en/events/iati-members-assembly-2019/" rel="nofollow noopener">last Members’ Assembly</a>, the IATI membership endorsed the plan for us to move “beyond the TAG” as our only channel for discussion and deliberation, and into two main vehicles:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Communities of Practice</strong> are the fora for practitioners to share, ask, answer and support one another.  Ideally, Communities of Practice are run on an open model, with some resource needed to avoid overlap and ensure engagement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Working Groups</strong> are tasked by the Board (maybe at the request of Members) to research, consider, discuss and propose answers to <em>specific</em> challenges we are facing.  They are time-bound, have resource to conduct themselves and are accountable.  We might consider them to be “technical”, but they also need to speak to, and involve those, that are not so “technical”.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Right now, I can’t see any evidence of WGs or CoP being in existence.  <strong>Please can someone on the IATI Board provide an update?</strong></p>
<p>And of course, to round off this thread - I think we have <strong>a perfect candidate for a Working Group and Community of Practice in terms the challenges COVID-19 is presenting</strong>.</p>
<p>Do others agree?</p>

          <title>Process for updating non-embedded (replicated) codelists?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[andylolz]]></dc:creator>
          <category>IATI Standard</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>The process for getting non-embedded (replicated) codelist changes into the standard was previously documented here: <a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Extra-Documentation/blob/9c54e586/en/codelists-guides/codelist-management.rst#updates-to-non-embedded-codelists" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Extra-Documentation/blob/9c54e586/en/codelists-guides/codelist-management.rst#updates-to-non-embedded-codelists</a></p>
<p>I don’t know if this process has changed, but I don’t think it’s documented anymore. See: <a href="http://reference.iatistandard.org/203/codelists-guides/codelist-management/#non-embedded-codelists-replicated" rel="nofollow noopener">http://reference.iatistandard.org/203/codelists-guides/codelist-management/#non-embedded-codelists-replicated</a></p>
<p>What is the process now? I’m asking specifically with reference to the recent (July) DAC codelist updates, as well as <a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Codelists-NonEmbedded/pull/302" rel="nofollow noopener">this bugfix</a> to re-add a number of removed withdrawn sector codes.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

          <title>Activity hierarchy- report same data several times?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[RichPepp]]></dc:creator>
          <category>IATI Standard</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Apologies if this has been discussed before, I can’t find the answer to what I am looking for</p>
<p>As I understand the 2.03 version allows for parent/child relationships between activities.  This works well for us, especially for framework agreements as we receive donor payments into a parent activity but then run individual activities in different countries and these can be handled as child activities.</p>
<p>My question then is to do with reporting things like sectors, sdg codes and countries.  If we ran one child activity in Afghanistan and another in Tajikistan would we declare each of those activities as being 100% Afghanistan and 100% Tajikistan (assuming equal financial value) and then the parent activity as 50% Afghanistan and 50% Tajikistan?</p>
<p>Similarly with sectors - do we declare everything both at the parent AND child level but with the appropriate percentages or is it assumed that the data flows up the chain towards the parent and we only declare it once at the furthest child level?</p>
<p>It’s easy enough to do either - I just want to get it right</p>
<p>Thanks all</p>
<p>Richard</p>

          <title>Location element: which elements are most useful to data users?</title>

          <category>IATI Standard</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Does anyone have information (beyond anecdotal) on which location sub-elements are most useful to data users? I’ve seen different combinations, but most usually just the point (coordinates) and name being given in the data. Here’s a list of the sub-elements.</p>
<p>location-reach<br>
location-id<br>
name<br>
description<br>
activity-description<br>
administrative<br>
point<br>
exactness<br>
location-class<br>
feature-designation</p>
<p>Look forward to hearing back!  Also, has anyone written or seen user-friendly guidance on how to use the location element? So this would be supplementary to the IATI element page, and any donor guidance. If it’s for Aidstream, even better!</p>

          <title>Relationship between `activity-status` and `activity-date`s</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[andylolz]]></dc:creator>
          <category>IATI Standard</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I have some basic questions, after reading <a class="mention" href="/u/anjesh">@anjesh</a>’s <a href="https://blog.yipl.com.np/quality-analysis-of-belgium-based-organisations-98614fb1d235">excellent blog</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Should an activity in implementation (an <code>activity-status</code> of 2) be allowed an actual end date?</li>
<li>Should an activity in pipeline/identification (an <code>activity-status</code> of 1) be allowed an actual start date, or actual end date?</li>
</ol>
<p>According to the standard, actual dates <a href="http://reference.iatistandard.org/203/rulesets/standard-ruleset/#iati-activity"><strong>must</strong> be in the past</a>. But the above rules aren’t currently included in <a href="http://reference.iatistandard.org/203/rulesets/standard-ruleset/">the standard ruleset</a>, or anywhere in the reference documentation. Should they be?</p>
<p>Asking this now because the ruleset is currently being worked on, and because the <a href="https://twitter.com/IATI_aid/status/1102542836476641280">new IATI Validator is around the corner</a> (congratulations, <a class="mention" href="/u/rolfkleef">@rolfkleef</a>!) which will do ruleset testing.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>In the past, there have been issues with the IATI reference site not reflecting the latest information on github, or failing to build (I gather because the deployment process is anomolous). This should help mitigate that.</p>

          <title>How about publishers that are MORE frequent that &quot;monthly&quot;?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[stevieflow]]></dc:creator>
          <category>IATI Standard</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi everyone</p>
<p>I think there are an increasing number of publishers that now maintain and update their IATI data on a rhythm that could be <em>more frequent</em> than monthly.  That’s good news!</p>
<p>This might be for those that update automatically via their systems <em>every day</em> - I know IFAD and Oxfam Novib (<a class="mention" href="/u/stolk">@stolk</a> ?) strive to do this.</p>
<p>In other contexts, such as humanitarian, it might also be more practical to update IATI data more often.</p>
<p>Right now, the only indicator we have for this is the Timeliness (<a href="http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/timeliness.html" rel="nofollow noopener">Frequency</a>) metric on the IATI dashboard. However, the <a href="http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/timeliness.html#h_assesment" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>maximum any organisation can achieve is monthly</strong></a>.</p>
<p>I guess the key questions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>do we want to know</strong> if any publishers update more frequently than monthly?</li>
<li>And if we do, <strong>how do we monitor that</strong>?</li>
</ul>
<p>(Slight complication: as <a class="mention" href="/u/bill_anderson">@bill_anderson</a> whilst points out there’s <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/changes-to-the-updating-of-dashboard-publisher-statistics/1172">no impact on monthly metrics with the changes to the dashboard update frequency</a>.  However, that  would suggest it seems  <em>impossible</em> for anyone to record as more frequent than monthly?)</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I recently learnt from my colleagues working on the Open Contracting Data Standard that a community-led <a href="http://standard.open-contracting.org/1.1-italian/it/" rel="nofollow noopener">Italian translation of the standard documentation now exists</a>.</p>
<p>OCDS already have the full documentation available in <a href="http://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/" rel="nofollow noopener">English</a>, <a href="http://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/es/" rel="nofollow noopener">Spanish</a> and <a href="http://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/fr/" rel="nofollow noopener">French</a>.  These are maintained centrally.</p>
<p>The whole process and technology used for this is <a href="https://ocds-standard-development-handbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/standard/translation/" rel="nofollow noopener">well documented, and integrated into the tech stack</a>.  This is linked to how OCDS generate documentation, built on some <a href="https://ocds-standard-development-handbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/standard/translation/" rel="nofollow noopener">key components and patterns</a> we have documented in an open standards handbook.</p>
<p>This all seems as one would expect for an international standard.</p>
<p>With IATI, we seem to have English only.  What do we need to do to change that?  It is a priority for the community, for members, for the Secretariat?</p>

          <title>Linking to IATI documentation from an activity</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[stevieflow]]></dc:creator>
          <category>IATI Standard</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I’ve been encouraging publishers I work with to include a <code>document-link</code> that goes back to a web page / document they maintain, which provides context about their IATI process/policy/publication.</p>
<p>Hence, with UNHCR, every activity includes a link back to <a href="http://reporting.unhcr.org/iati" rel="nofollow noopener">their IATI page</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/original/1X/5f65ad79177ce0d75a3e4f60b7c3cf16540d3145.png" alt="d-portal%20(5)" width="332" height="76"></p>
<p>This isn’t strictly a “project document”, and might well be frowned upon by those who only expect certain codes/documents, but I think the arguments to support this would be well-received: it makes the <em>data</em> more <em>useful</em>. :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Any IATI activity could be presented in any other portal/search results - out of context from the original XML publication (and far far away from the IATI Registry). Hence, providing some link back to documentation <em>within the activity</em> helps people (the data users) wanting to find out more.  It’s like a consistent footnote for each and every activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Publishers can / could be encouraged to provide details of the decisions they have made along their IATI journey in these documents.  It might even help explain any particular namespaces, or hierarchies or any data behavours one should expect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Elsewhere - when using vocabulary 99 codes, we encourage the publication of a URL to access the complete vocabulary. I see this link to documentation as a place to put this in context.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It’d be useful to hear what others think of this.  Technically, this “breaks” the standard!  I’ve posted elsewhere about the <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/background-for-document-category-codes/1481">background the document category codes</a>, as this might need some focus and discussion.</p>

          <title>Should percentages sum to 100%?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[stevieflow]]></dc:creator>
          <category>IATI Standard</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>When we have multiple <code>sector</code> or <code>recipient-country/region</code> in any activity, the <a href="http://reference.iatistandard.org/203/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/sector/" rel="nofollow noopener">standard seems quite clear</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All reported sectors from the same vocabulary MUST add up to 100.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve always read the MUST as being a MUST!</p>
<p>However, I know that it might not always be possible to get to <em>exactly</em> 100% in some instances, particularly where there might be rounding (I think we found this with Canada data <a class="mention" href="/u/yohannaloucheur">@YohannaLoucheur</a>?)</p>
<p>I’m aware that tools such as DataWorkBench also allow a tolerance around this (correct <a class="mention" href="/u/rolfkleef">@rolfkleef</a>?) so it would be interesting to hear thoughts on whether:</p>
<p>a) we should consider a validation tolerance for the sum of multiple percentages (99-101%?)<br>
b) and if so, how do we document that?</p>
<p>I’m sure <a class="mention" href="/u/oj_">@OJ_</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/herman">@Herman</a> might have thoughts</p>

          <title>Background for document category codes?</title>

            <p>I’m looking at the <a href="http://reference.iatistandard.org/203/codelists/DocumentCategory/" rel="nofollow noopener">Document Category codes</a> , which are split between categories for activity and organisational level documents - eg:</p>
<p><img src="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/original/1X/bce7a5aee42be3a0ac5c03499c37b4e50788f610.png" alt="Document%20Category%20%20%20The%20IATI%20Standard" width="558" height="201"></p>
<p>All these categories are missing a Description field – which might be useful to help publishers determine exactly which category to choose</p>
<p>My question is whether there is any background material in terms of where these codes were derived from.  I don’t think these codes are CRS related, for example - and they seem to have been in place since the start of IATI time…</p>
<p>Paging <span class="mention">@OJ</span>_ <a class="mention" href="/u/bill_anderson">@bill_anderson</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/herman">@Herman</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/theo.sande">@theo.sande</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/yohannaloucheur">@YohannaLoucheur</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/johnadams">@JohnAdams</a></p>
<p>Additionally - has anyone in the community written extra guidance around document categories…? <a class="mention" href="/u/sjohns">@SJohns</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/ariag">@ariag</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/rolfkleef">@rolfkleef</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/amys">@amys</a> ?</p>
<p>(elsewhere, there were some posts about the relevance and use of these codes to CSOs: <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/document-category-codes/313">here</a> &amp; <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/relevance-use-of-document-category-codes-for-csos/312">here</a>)</p>

          <title>How to link donor activities to implementing partner activities</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[RichPepp]]></dc:creator>
          <category>IATI Standard</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi folks.  I’ve been looking at various discussions on how to link data between different publishers (e.g. <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/using-related-activity-to-link-data-between-different-publishers/288">Using related-activity to link data between different publishers</a>) and I just wanted to check that my current understanding is correct.  I understand that there is no intention for full accounting level trace-ability but we do want to be able to follow the money.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We shouldn’t use related-activities to link donor to implementing org activities.   Instead that link is made through transactions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ideally we should provide <span class="mention">@provider-activity-id</span> in the incoming transaction to match the donor activity but  we might not always know that.  It any case we should be matching amounts and dates</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>related-activities and parent/child relationships should really be restricted to within our own organisation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s basic stuff but there appear to be a few different ways to achieve the same aim so I would rather follow the same practices as others</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Richard</p>

          <title>IATI Dashboard &gt; Publishing Statistics - use of BudgetNotProvided?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[stevieflow]]></dc:creator>
          <category>IATI Standard</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The IATI Dashboard contains a metric for provision of the <a href="http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/comprehensiveness_financials.html" rel="nofollow noopener">Budget element in Comprehensiveness</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the hierarchy which contains the greatest number of budgets, the percentage of all current activities that contain at least one valid budget entry. A valid budget entry must contain a valid period-start AND a valid period-end AND a valid value AND a valid value-date.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2.03 a new attribute was introduce <a href="http://reference.iatistandard.org/203/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/#iati-activities-iati-activity-budget-not-provided" rel="nofollow noopener">@budget-not-provided</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A code indicating the reason why this activity does not contain any iati-activity/budget elements. The value must exist in the BudgetNotProvided codelist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The question therefore - do activities with the <span class="mention">@budget-not-provided</span> attribute get omitted from the Dashboard budget metric?</p>

          <title>Question about updated 2.03 &#39;value&#39; attribute</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Eimis]]></dc:creator>
          <category>IATI Standard</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello! I have a question. I am porting our application to support IATI v. 2.03. On the 2.03 changelog it says, that for iati-activities/iati-activity/result/indicator/period/target element, the attribute <span class="mention">@value</span> was made optional and rules for its use added (see: <a href="http://reference.iatistandard.org/203/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/result/indicator/period/target/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://reference.iatistandard.org/203/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/result/indicator/period/target/</a>). Although, in the documentation it doesn’t mention what are the possible values of this element.</p>
<p>In the discussion (<a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/results-represent-more-than-quantitative-data-included-2-03/872/48">Results – represent more than quantitative data (included 2.03)</a>) Mike Smith says, that the <span class="mention">@value</span> attribute has to be a valid number. But is this official ? If so, what kind of number ? Why this number is not specified in the documentation (<a href="http://reference.iatistandard.org/203/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/result/indicator/period/target/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://reference.iatistandard.org/203/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/result/indicator/period/target/</a>) ? Can it include absolutely any string ?</p>
<p>Hope someone can help me with this and tell me what are the ‘official’ requirements.</p>

          <title>IATI 2.03 and data validation</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Eimis]]></dc:creator>
          <category>IATI Standard</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hey guys! I’m a new guy here (I’m a Python developer), I’m working with IATI data (I’m building some custom data validation tools) and I have a question about IATI datasets and their validation.</p>
<p>Could anyone point me to a single Dataset which would be fully compliant with IATI v. 2.03 (or at least 2.02) and which would be clean and valid (based on 2.03 rules)? I believe that in the whole registry there should he at least 1 file which should be valid. I checked 5 files in a row, manually compared them with 2.03 rules and the files are far from valid.</p>
<p>Unfortunately when you run the file through <a href="http://validator.iatistandard.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://validator.iatistandard.org/</a>, it gives no error messages. Why it’s not working is a separate question. But what I want to find is at least a single file which would help me to start building working validation tools for the datasets. Is there one ?</p>
<p>thanks and cheers,<br>

            <p><em>[I <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/locating-translated-codelists/464/16">already posted this here</a>, but thought I’d post it separately as it’s quite cool.]</em></p>
<p>The current <a href="http://iatistandard.org/203/">IATI standard site</a> is automatically built from the schema, codelists, rulesets, guidance and extra documentation. The tool that builds it is (almost) set up to build in multiple languages, but the feature hasn’t been put to use.</p>
<p>I tried auto-building and deploying a multilingual version of the site (with a dropdown to switch between languages). Here’s an example page that’s (partially) in French:<br>
<a href="https://andylolz.github.io/iatistandard-multilingual/fr/203/codelists/ConditionType/" class="onebox" target="_blank">https://andylolz.github.io/iatistandard-multilingual/fr/203/codelists/ConditionType/</a></p>
<p>Obviously most of the site hasn’t been translated – I guess no-one has done this, since it wasn’t visible anywhere. But I expect this could be of use.</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Just spent longer than I care to admit investigating how IATI handles SDGs both now and post-January. Would someone please ELI5 (explain like I’m 5)?</p>
<p>I think the following is true…after reading all the threads at the bottom of this post - please confirm:</p>
<ul>
<li>The standard allows users to use the Sector element to report SDG goals, targets, and indicator via the <a href="http://iatistandard.org/202/codelists/SectorVocabulary/" rel="nofollow noopener">SectorVocabulary</a> codelist.</li>
<li>The standard also allows for the reporting of indicators via Results, and the SDG codelist is to be added to <a href="http://iatistandard.org/202/codelists/IndicatorVocabulary/" rel="nofollow noopener">IndicatorVocabulary</a> as MDGs were.</li>
<li>The standard also allows, and many have suggested, using Policy Markers or the new (2.03) Tag element to ‘tag’ SDGs without %s.</li>
</ul>
<p>Is there a written or unwritten best practice about how organizations should publish SDG information? I’m sensing confusion but it could just be me. Thanks!</p>

Since the SDGs are currently reported under the IATI sector codelists, you are obliged to include a percentage per SDG. However, determining how much an activity contributes to an SDG or how much of the budget is spent per SDG is very arbitrary. An activity can contribute 100% to several SDGs.

          <title>How to keep the IATI standard aligned with the IATI’s mission and vision?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Herman]]></dc:creator>
          <category>IATI Standard</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Last year IATI’s  member’s assembly discussed and approved a new vision and mission document (see  <a href="http://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Paper-3-Board-Paper-on-Strategic-direction-for-IATI-2016-2018.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">Strategic direction for IATI</a>) outlining the strategic direction IATI should take in the years to come.</p>
<p>In the initial years, IATI has focused on persuading organizations to become publishers in IATI. In that light, IATI could be very liberal and accommodating in facilitating proposals for change of the standard. As of last year the vision and mission has changed in the direction of increasing the relevance and stimulating the use of our data. Therefore, proposals for change have to be viewed in that context: does the proposed change contribute to the relevance and use of IATI data.</p>
<p>That is easier said than done. The challenge is to translate the rather abstract concepts of data quality and data use to the operational level. When failing to do so we will risk that the standard develops in other directions, further increasing in complexity and scope, without contributing to the relevance and use of IATI data. Concerns about the complexity and scope of the standard and its negative impact on data use, have also been expressed on the 2017 TAG where John Adams hosted a session about the future of IATI.</p>
<p>So how to bridge to gap between the abstract concepts data use and quality to the operational level used to discuss, define and assess IATI upgrade proposals? What seems to be lacking is an intermediate, more fine-grained level of criteria, making it possible to assess the alignment of change proposals. Having participated in quite some discussions on the forum, I missed these criteria. Therefore I propose to develop a set of criteria, which reflect the essence of IATI’s vision and mission and which can be used in practice.</p>
<p>To clarify what I mean I will present some example criteria, their rationale and what it would mean if the criteria are applied to a change proposal:</p>
<p>Example 1: let’s assume that we have a criterion ‘<strong>Changes to the standard should promote that IATI stakeholders speak a common language</strong>’ with as rationale that speaking a common language facilitates data use among different stakeholders. If I were to propose to add a new sector vocabulary with the Netherlands MFA internal sector classifications, this change would not be approved since it would make it more difficult to do sector analysis, using data of multiple publishers.</p>
<p>Example 2: let’s say we have a ‘consistency’ criterion <strong>Changes to the IATI standard should increase and not decrease the internal consistency of the standard</strong> with as rationale that consistency improves the ease of use of data. Having this criterion in the past could have prevented introducing the inconsistencies in the results standard, now fixed in 2.03</p>
<p>Example 3: let’s say we have a ‘relevancy’ criterion <strong>'Changes to the IATI standard should be relevant for a majority of IATI users in at least one constituency</strong>. The rational of this criterion could be that changes that are only relevant for a small part of the IATI community, will increase the complexity of the standard and make data use harder, but not benefit many users. To illustrate this point: currently 31% of all IATI elements are published by less than 10 publishers (source <a href="http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/elements.html" rel="nofollow noopener">IATI dashboard elements</a> )!</p>
<p>The real value of developing these criteria is i.m.o. that we have a common understanding of what we mean with data usability and data quality on a level that can be used in practice. I would like to hear what you think about this, maybe have some other examples and add some thoughts.</p>

          <title>Secondary Publishers: A Manifesto! ...and some honest questions</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[reidmporter]]></dc:creator>
          <category>IATI Standard</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Had a great chat with <a class="mention" href="/u/wendy">@Wendy</a> just now about secondary publishers and at her suggestion, I wanted to open up the dialog to others.</p>
<p>There has of course been several conversations about secondary publishers and related attributes (see:  <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/modify-definition-of-secondary-publisher-included-2-03/846">Modify definition of secondary publishers</a> or <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/add-an-organisationrole-code-for-responsible-organisation-excluded-2-03/855">Add an OrganisationRole Code for “Responsible” organisation</a>) but we wanted to take a step back and approach the issue from a less technical, more philosophical perspective.</p>
<p>(From here on out, while I may reference other secondary publishers, I’m speaking only on behalf of InterAction/NGO Aid Map. I’ll let AidData, Foundation Center, Global Giving, OCHA FTS, etc. speak for themselves <img src="//discuss.iatistandard.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> )</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#The</span> Case for Secondary Publishers<br>
InterAction, which publishers second-hand data via NGO Aid Map, has perceived that secondary publishers are not exactly embraced with open arms by the IATI community, given its well-established principles related to data ownership, organizational accountability, and commitment to transparency. These points are well taken, and we are aware of and own the fact that NGO Aid Map data does muddy the waters a bit where it is duplicative, ill-suited to existing data use tools, and published with fuzzy provenance. However, we believe that secondary publishers do and should continue to play an important role in the IATI community and data ecosystem.</p>
<p>How you might ask?</p>
<h2>…as Intermediaries</h2>
<p>While great efforts have and are being taken to distill the complexities of IATI and its tools to various audiences, there are simply segments of that audience that are still being missed. This is where platforms like NGO Aid Map and InterAction as an organization can act as intermediaries. Not only does the platform simplify the interface and data publication process, but it removes some of the burden from the IATI Secretariat to provide user friendly tools and assistance to niche groups of publishers, such as small to medium CSO/NGOs, especially those in the US that are not as far along as their counterparts in Europe and elsewhere. NGO Aid Map and InterAction staff can provide personalized guidance and simplified publishing processes to ensure that more NGOs are able to publish their data and with a shorter turnaround time. In the case of small NGOs with limited capacity, we consider it fitting that the Secretariat and even the broader IATI community focus on “bigger fish” and allow organizations like InterAction, Bond, and others to act as interlocutors, trainers, and advocates on their behalf. (Of course, Bond and others have played this role to a greater extent than InterAction has historically, as the US government has not yet implemented reporting requirements based on IATI for its recipients nor funded any kind of broad capacity development support focused on IATI.)</p>
<h2>…as Champions</h2>
<p>NGO Aid Map was originally designed to showcase members’ project data. Mapping our own data model to the standard was in part an acknowledgement that many US-based NGOs are unlikely to publish data to the IATI registry without an explicit mandate from one of their funders. By providing a mechanism for NGOs to achieve compliance (albeit limited) with the IATI standard, we can support the IATI community in making the case for transparency and in broadening participation. We also have several additional benefits that we can offer as incentives to pull our members in, namely immediate mapping and visualization tools and a well-known platform for promoting activities. Indeed, many of our members report finding partners or having funders find them using this platform.</p>
<h2>…as Partners</h2>
<p>InterAction has demonstrated a firm commitment to transparency, open data, and technological innovation, both within its membership and in the wider world. Whether through the Initiative for Open Ag Funding, NGO Aid Map, or some future collaboration, we intend to continue support for the mission and purpose of IATI in time, money, word, and deed. The same is true for many other similar organizations around the world. We welcome any opportunity to work with the Secretariat on any other initiative such as the Grand Bargain to bring new organizations in and to engage new markets. Given the limitations of the Secretariat and Grand Bargain monitoring initiative, the underrepresentation of some types of organizations in the Technical Advisory Group, and the scale of the challenges ahead, we would like to deepen our partnership rather than operate a competing, parallel, or duplicative service.</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#HOWEVER</span>, we can do better ourselves…</p>
<p>While we maintain that platforms like NGO Aid Map serve an important purpose, we do recognize that we have work to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Continue adapting NGO Aid Map to new changes in the standard, as well as any recommended changes in the IATI guidelines specific to secondary publishers. We are in the process of adding humanitarian fields as part of the v2.02 upgrade effort, and will revisit once v2.03 is live.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work with InterAction members to establish individual IATI accounts so that they can either publish data on their own or explicitly grant NGO Aid Map/InterAction the right to do so on their behalf, provided they agree to the same commitments and duties required of every publisher.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that there is no duplication between members that publish on their own and via NGO Aid Map (in theory, we have an opt-out checkbox, but in practice there may be a very small number of organizations that are represented twice).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encourage and support our members in adapting and improving their internal data systems to remove the burdensome aspects of publishing quarterly IATI data.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>And now, some honest questions</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For those organizations that choose not to open their own IATI accounts and publish on their own, does the addition of their data–via NGO Aid Map–add value to the data corpus, or do users find it confusing?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Again, for those that choose not to publish on their own, while it is technically possible for us to remove and replace “NGO Aid Map” as the reporting-org and replace it with the name of the accountable organization, we do not feel that this solution is A) transparent about who is actually doing the publishing, B) a positive incentive for them to take ownership of their data publication, C) an accurate representation of the primary purpose of NGO Aid Map (a database that publishes to IATI rather than an IATI publication tool). Thoughts? What would be the preference of this community?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For initiatives like the Grand Bargain, the InterAction-shepherded <a href="https://www.interaction.org/document/us-ngo-commitments-world-humanitarian-summit" rel="nofollow noopener">NGO Commitments made at the World Humanitarian Summit in support of the Grand Bargain</a>, and IATI in general, we strongly believe that NGO Aid Map, while not intended as a robust and comprehensive IATI publication tool, can serve a useful purpose as a stepping stone and on-ramp to the world of open data and IATI. Perhaps this need is most keenly felt in the US, where IATI has been a bit more of a rude awakening for many organizations in the past year. Are there strong opinions from this community about secondary-publishers-as-a-stepping-stone? How would you suggest we use our available assets (a data corpus and visualization platform, namely NGO Aid Map) to bridge the gap between an ideal world (everyone publishes brilliant data on a timely basis without issue) and reality (siloed data systems, significant manual effort, reluctance to invest in HQ data systems, accelerated pace of IATI and other data publication requirements, lack of funding for capacity building in most countries, etc.)?</p>
</li>
</ul>

          <title>Examples of well-implemented IATI extensions?</title>

          <category>IATI Standard</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Quick question to all the wonks - can anyone show me an example of a well-executed extension of IATI data the <em>isn’t</em> the United States? Their namespace link isn’t working: <a href="http://beta.foreignassistance.gov/assets/Organisations/DOS%20and%20USAID.xml" rel="nofollow noopener">http://beta.foreignassistance.gov/assets/Organisations/DOS%20and%20USAID.xml</a> (I’m aware this might change, but am impatient).</p>
<p>(Further question - is there any way of finding these activities with extensions through the datastore, dashboard, OIPA, or D-portal? My suspicion is that there isn’t, but I’d be interested to hear.)</p>

            <p>Has anyone published rich content including pictures in IATI format?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Pictures. How are you including the files - as document-link? What document-category do you use? How are you labelling, captioning?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rich text context - are you using the multiple description types?</p>
</li>
</ol>

          <title>Policy Significance - how to express &quot;not screened&quot; (blank)? Clarification help needed</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[stevieflow]]></dc:creator>
          <category>IATI Standard</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Via some work with a publishing organisation I took at look at the Policy <a href="http://iatistandard.org/202/codelists/PolicyMarker/" rel="nofollow noopener">Marker</a> &amp; <a href="http://iatistandard.org/202/codelists/PolicySignificance/" rel="nofollow noopener">Significance</a> code lists:</p>
<p>The source for these is the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/dacandcrscodelists.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">OECD DAC codelist</a> spreadsheet.</p>
<p>Where I am slightly “confused” is that the OECD DAC list has a specific value of (blank):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(blank)	not screened</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whereas a value of 0 is different:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>0	not targeted</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is my understanding that a (blank) value in a CRS return indicates a specific choice in the data return, it is not purely a missing value.  This indicates something <em>different</em> to a 0, conceptually.</p>
<p>However, I am unclear how this (blank) can be expressed via IATI XML, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The IATI <a href="http://iatistandard.org/202/codelists/PolicySignificance/" rel="nofollow noopener">PolicySignificance</a> codelist does not contain a (blank) value</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It does not seem to be <em>useful</em> to publish the <span class="mention">@significance</span> attribute with a blank value, or missing entirely - eg:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>policy-marker vocabulary="1" code="3" significance="" 
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>policy-marker vocabulary="1" code="3" 
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m interested to know if others have discovered this, and how they have worked with/around it.  Or - if it is not an issue.</p>
