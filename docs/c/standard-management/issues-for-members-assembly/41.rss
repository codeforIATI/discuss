            <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V5QEyJFhHxxKZLqBdxkIIk-gZL7apVf1iZo6lJ4NaXc/edit?usp=sharing">Here is a draft discussion document on proposed changes to our upgrade procedures</a> that will be submitted to the Member’s Assembly in October. The more that we can agree on before we get to Rome, the more likely we are to come away with a framework that works for all. I would urge everyone who has expressed interest in this matter to engage.</p>
<p>Could you make major comments in this thread (quoting sections here when relevant) and restrict comments on the Google Doc to finer/pedantic points.</p>
<p>This document is very different from the one we presented in Dar es Salaam. Hopefully it takes on board the further learnings we have gone through with 2.03 over the past months.</p>
<p>The biggest change is to make a clear distinction between content and technical implementation. We propose that we should formally approve the content - the explicit use cases for each proposal - before going anywhere near schemas, xml, etc.</p>
<p>Other changes include</p>
<ul>
<li>New responsibilities for the Governing Board in initiating and approving decimal upgrades and overseeing integers</li>
<li>Procedures for involving the Governing Board in resolving disputes.</li>
<li>Specifying the necessary phases of an upgrade without prescribing the timeline (which should be determined on a case-by-case basis to take into account likely complexity and TAG and MA meeting timings).</li>
</ul>
<p>I look forward to an open and constructive discussion.</p>

          <title>Technical measures to improve/incentivise better data quality</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[dalepotter]]></dc:creator>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Following the conversations in thread: <a href="//discuss.iatistandard.org/t/tag-tech-consult-outline-agenda/534/8">TAG Tech Consult: Outline Agenda</a>, this tread is set-up to discuss technical measures that could be introduced to incentivise/improve better data quality.</p>
<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>The need for improved data quality follows recent shortfalls identified by real-world attempts to use IATI data, most notably Young Innovations attempts to use <a href="https://blog.yipl.com.np/tanzanian-iati-data-diving-into-sectors-with-focus-on-health-ba71398fd1e#.3wix20hz5">Tanzanian IATI Data</a>. The <a href="http://bd-iati.github.io/blog/2016/03/08/what-we-learned-in-3-weeks/">Bangladesh IATI – AIMS import project</a>, <a href="//discuss.iatistandard.org/t/data-quality-issues/488/7">other threads on IATI Discuss</a> and the <a href="http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/data_quality.html">IATI Dashboard</a> also highlight other issues with the use of IATI data.</p>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/bill_anderson">@bill_anderson</a> has suggested some specific ideas are needed regarding, for instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>What should be validated?</li>
<li>How should it be validated?</li>
<li>What happens with invalid data?</li>
<li>How should the Registry handle invalid data?</li>
<li>How should the Dashboard handle invalid data?</li>
<li>How should Publisher Statistics handle invalid data?</li>
<li>Should good quality data be ‘kitemarked’?</li>
<li>NB If there is a need for discussions on tools, support, etc these belong on Day 2 and 3</li>
</ul>
<h2>One tangible proposal: Force initial publication and updates through the IATI Registry</h2>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/herman">@Herman</a> has <a href="https://twitter.com/HermanLoon/status/826817934152589312">suggested on Twitter</a> that most issues could be solved by making the IATI validation more restrictive and mandatory for publishing on the Registry.</p>
<p>This is a sensible idea and would stop publication of bad data at source. However, this would not necessarily make the situation better, as, under the current situation, publishers post a URL of their self-hosted IATI XML file on the <a href="http://www.iatiregistry.org/">IATI Registry</a>. This self-hosted file can then be modified any number of times without re-posting to the Registry, providing that the URL itself does not change.  This means that checking a file is valid on initial publication does not mean it will be valid when a publisher updates the location that file.</p>
<p>To solve this problem - and if it is agreed that forcing initial publication <strong>and</strong> all updates to be published through the Registry (with validation on each publication) is a good idea - changes would need to be made to how updated data is accessed. Some options:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>All IATI data would be held on the IATI Registry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find a clever way to keep IATI XML files self-hosted but ‘cache’ each update.  Each publication (initial or update) via the Registry would generate a unique Registry URL, which resolves to the data that was published at that point.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Would be good to hear everyone’s thoughts on these technical measures.</p>

          <title>Tech paper: Improvements to publishing statistics methodologies</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[bill_anderson]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Issues for Members Assembly</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p><a href="http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/publishing_stats.html">Publishing Statistics</a> are calculated nightly to asses the quality of data being published. The methodologies employed are still being fine-tuned to ensure the statistics produced are both fair and accurate.</p>
<p><strong>Coverage</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/coverage.html">Coverage</a> assesses what proportion of an organisation’s total output is published through IATI. The current methodology involves the manual collection of reference spend data by the Technical Team. This is very time consuming and unsustainable. The long term solution is for publishers to <a href="//discuss.iatistandard.org/t/tech-paper-improvements-to-the-organisation-standard/543">self-report through the Organisation standard</a> and for the Technical Team to do random checks on this data. An interim measure is also required as self-reporting will take some time to establish itself.</p>
<p><strong>Forward Looking</strong></p>
<p>Not all activities can be expected to have forward-looking budgets. The methodology for deciding which activities are exempt from assessment needs refinement. These include fast-onset humanitarian emergencies and commercially sensitive contracts.</p>
<p><strong>Humanitarian Reporting</strong></p>
<p>The Grand Bargain agreed at the World Humanitarian Summit requires monitoring. This requires some careful thinking. For example real time reporting is best practice for fast onset emergencies, but how does a machine determine when such an emergency is in play and which publishers are involved?</p>
<p>This paper outline is part of the <a href="//discuss.iatistandard.org/t/tag-tech-consult-outline-agenda/534">Agenda</a> for the IATI TAG 2016 <a href="//discuss.iatistandard.org/t/technical-consultation-workshop/533">Technical Consultation Workshop</a></p>

          <title>Tech Paper: Deprecation of old versions of the standard</title>

            <p>There are currently no policies or guidelines relating to the continuing validity of old versions of the standard. There is a clear need for the earliest versions to now be deprecated. We welcome proposals as to how this should be approached and implemented.</p>

          <title>Tech Paper: Revised rules for decimal and integer upgrades</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The current upgrade rules were agreed by the IATI Steering Committee in October 2011 (<a href="http://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Paper-4.b-First-Integer-Upgrade-to-the-Standard.doc">see Annex here</a>). It was agreed at the <a href="http://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Paper-7-Technical-updates.pdf">Members Assembly meeting in June 2016</a> that they were in need of revision and that the Technical Team would prepare a proposal and consult on it so that it is ready for approval by the 2017 Members Assembly.</p>
<p>A paper will be prepared which will review governance, content, timing and consultation processes.</p>
