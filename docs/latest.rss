          <title>Discuss is going into read-only mode</title>

            <p>Dear Discuss-community,</p>
<p>As you know we will be migrating this platform, both content and users, to the new IATI Connect platform. As of  <strong>Wednesday 25 of November - 12pm (GMT/UTC)  IATI Discuss will be in read-only mode</strong>. This allows us to move all content over for the launch on the 30th.</p>
<p>The new IATI Connect will have:</p>
<ul>
<li>A dedicated space for the Discuss-Archive (containing our current Discuss and a link to existing archive);</li>
<li>Ongoing / specific discussions will be integrated into the new IATI Communities, and would hopefully provide an opportunity to widen the audience and embed it into the wider IATI discussions;</li>
<li>IATI-wide consultations and technical discussions, such as the Standard Management category, will be housed under the IATI Connect Consultations;</li>
</ul>
<p>What does this mean for you in practice?</p>
<ul>
<li>Every migration takes some time. Therefore, as of Wednesday 25th of November - 12pm (GMT/UTC) the Discuss-content and users will be ‘on the move’. Any changes made on Discuss post 12pm (should be disabled) and will definitely not be moved across to the new platform.</li>
<li>You will all receive a notification (by email) once we have arrived at our new location: IATI Connect. Through that notification you will be assigned a new profile on the platform (which is pre-arranged) and additional relevant onboarding information.</li>
<li>IATI Discuss will stay in read-only mode for 6 months before being removed. This will allow us time to make sure no content is lost and is findable on the new platform.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you access your profile, you’ll be able to join a Community of Practice, register for events, contribute to discussions, see other content specific to those groups, and much more.</p>
<p>Of course we hope everything will go smoothly, but every migration is exciting. In case you have any questions or comments please send us an email through <a href="mailto:connect@iatistandard.org">connect@iatistandard.org</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you for your understanding, and we look forward to seeing you ‘on the other side’.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>IATI Secretariat</p>

            <p><strong>Webinar: Using near real-time IATI data to track aid flows during the Covid-19 crisis</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date: 30th November 2020</strong></p>
<p><strong>Time: 12 noon-1pm GMT</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hosted by: Development Initiatives</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJYoc-mvrTwtE9I36cFB2b2sa_v9WsLGpgbc"><strong>Register here</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Moderator: Carolyn Culey, Director of Engagement and Partnerships</strong></p>
<p><strong>Speakers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Global analysis – Amy Dodd, Head of Engagement</strong></li>
<li><strong>East Africa analysis – Martha Bekele, Senior Analyst</strong></li>
<li><strong>Methodology – Bill Anderson, Information Architect</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>During the current Covid-19 crisis, having data on aid spending in as near to real-time as possible, has never been more important in understanding current trends and informing decisions. Detailed information on ODA spending in 2020 will not be published by the OECD DAC until the end of 2021. DI’s analysis uses near real-time IATI data to show <a href="https://devinit.org/resources/how-aid-changing-covid-19-pandemic/">how aid is changing during the Covid-19 pandemic</a>, and examines the implications of this. While our initial report focusses on global trends, a forthcoming report by our analysts’ team in East Africa looks at country-level data in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, and Rwanda.</p>
<p><strong>DI will present key findings from both reports, followed by a Q&amp;A session on these.</strong></p>
<p>Using IATI data in this way has presented both opportunities and challenges. In the second part of this webinar, DI will explain the methodology behind our analysis and highlight some of the issues we have encountered in using real-time IATI data. These are being logged and shared with IATI’s business analysts, to provide a feedback loop to publishers so they can further improve the quality of their data, to make it more usable for analysts.</p>
<p><strong>There will be a further round of Q&amp;A on methodology and on data challenges.</strong></p>

          <title>UX Research for IATI- deadline 20 November</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[IATI-techteam]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Welcome to IATI Discuss</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p><strong>IATI are seeking a UX Researcher to understand more about IATI publishers and the functionality they require as they publish to IATI.</strong></p>
<p>The IATI Governing Board has asked the Secretariat to conduct an options analysis to assess potential approaches to a publishing tool. While we have already learned a great deal about our diverse community of more than 1,200 publishers of different types and sizes, we need to understand more about our publishers and the functionality they require as they publish to IATI. This will enable us to analyse options for a publishing tool based on publisher input. All sizes of publishing organisations should be consulted as part of this exercise.</p>
<p>For more information, please see the <a href="https://devinit.org/work-for-us/vacancies/independent-consultant-ux-researcher-iati/">specific requirements and deliverables on this page</a>. Please share with your networks!</p>

          <title>Humanitarian Scope - Activity/Transaction Level</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[AVaughn]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Humanitarian</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Colleagues -</p>
<p>Earlier this summer USAID realized that placement of the Humanitarian Scope at the transaction level was causing a critical validation error in the IATI Validator (original post <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/current-discussion-quantifying-percentage-of-funds-allocated-from-an-activity-to-covid-19/1939/7">here</a>). USAID puts many details (such as country, sector) at the transaction level to improve the granularity of activity information. If we put Humanitarian Scope with the activity level, we will lose significant granularity in our information, as well as dramatically over-count USAID efforts to specific responses. Additionally, elements such as cluster code and glide code can differ among the transactions within one USAID activity.</p>
<p>Initially, USAID decided the best interim solution would be to intentionally continue reporting Humanitarian Scope at the transaction level in order to preserve the granularity of our data. Because this is a critical validation error, however, we have now transitioned to “namespace” the element.</p>
<p>Rather than continue using this workaround, USAID would like to see the IATI standard revised to accommodate the Humanitarian Scope at the transaction level in the same way recipient countries and sectors can be reported at the activity level or transaction level. This will not affect publishers who include this data at the activity level, but will allow for more granularity for those who want to publish transaction-level data. Additionally, we believe this improved granularity will be more useful for data users.</p>
<p>It would be great to discuss this with others.</p>

          <title>Share views and join user-testing for IATI’s new community platform (November 12th)</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Dear Discuss-community,</p>
<p>We have exciting news to share with you! As laid out in IATI’s Workplan 2020, approved by the Governing Board in late 2019, the IATI Secretariat will be launching a new digital community platform by the end of the year. IATI’s new platform will be more inclusive with lots of useful new features. Here are a few:</p>
<p>●	Automated translations of all posts in multiple language;<br>
●	New Communities of Practice where stakeholder groups can discuss their specific open data and IATI needs with their peers;<br>
●	General discussions feature (like IATI Discuss!);<br>
●	A dedicated resource library and training portal;</p>
<p><strong>Oh no - are IATI Discuss posts disappearing??</strong></p>
<p>No, definitely not. We are working to ensure that all content (live and archived) on Discuss will be transferred to the new platform and Discuss users will smoothly transition onto the new platform with as little change to your user experience as possible.<br>
The Secretariat is working hard to plan this transition and Discuss will not be archived until the new platform has been tested, is up and running and working well. The Secretariat will ensure all Discuss users are able to easily move onto the new platform and inform you accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Share your views and join user-testing on Thursday November 12th</strong></p>
<p>As some of the most active members of our community, your feedback on the new community platform is very valuable. To that end we would like to invite you to an online user testing workshop of the new platform on <strong>Thursday 12th of November 9-10am (NYC), 2-3pm (WAT / UK), 3-4pm (CET)</strong>. We only have limited spaces as we want to ensure a manageable and interactive workshop. Want to join? <em><strong>Express your interest in this user-testing workshop before November 1st via <a href="mailto:sander.hees@undp.org">sander.hees@undp.org</a>.</strong></em></p>
<p>The Secretariat is here to help! Please also share your views or comments on the (technical) migration from Discuss to IATI’s new community-platform with me via <a href="mailto:sander.hees@undp.org">sander.hees@undp.org</a>.<br>
Best,</p>

          <title>Reverso validator?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[matmaxgeds]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Welcome to IATI Discuss</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi - would it be possible to have the validator return a list of all the ‘errors’ in IATI data, and then e.g. the number of cases for each one (grouped by error, not by the datafile)? I think the validator stores runs tests on the data in the background so this might be feasible? Or maybe it would be a specific job that looped through all the files - perhaps possible via the validator API?</p>

            <p>Dear reader,</p>
<p>I have been including transactions for my organization into AIDstream. I tried to publish our data to IATI but I repeatedly receive a pop-up warning that our publisher ID (under registry information) was not correct. However, I don’t understand which publisher ID should be placed, because our IATI publisher ID is somehow not valid.</p>
<p>If anyone can help me in this issue, I look very much forward to your reply. The AIDstream support desk was unfortunately not of any help.</p>
<p>Warm regards from the Netherlands,<br>
Naomi</p>

          <title>IATI&#39;s Datastore and Validator Tools launched</title>

            <p>IATI is delighted to announce the launch today of its new <a href="https://iatidatastore.iatistandard.org/home">Datastore</a> and <a href="https://iativalidator.iatistandard.org/">Validator</a>, fulfilling a commitment to members to provide robust tools to improve the quality and use of development and humanitarian data published to IATI.</p>
<ol>
<li>Why use the new IATI Datastore?</li>
<li>Why use the new IATI Validator?</li>
<li>Get support: online guidance and webinars</li>
<li>What’s changed since the testing phase?</li>
<li>Deprecation of old Datastore and Public Validator - 22 March 2021</li>
<li>Upcoming work</li>
</ol>
<p>Developing and building these new tools has been the result of a close collaboration between the IATI Secretariat and suppliers Zimmerman and Data4Development, and thanks are also due to our dedicated community for testing the new tools and helping us to improve them.</p>
<p>The following information is provided to enable our community of publishers and users to easily transition to using the new tools and get help through webinars and detailed guidance. It also outlines planning for subsequent phases of development to continually improve our suite of IATI tools.</p>
<h3>Why use the new IATI Datastore?</h3>
<p>The new IATI Datastore allows for much more detailed queries and searches of IATI data than previously possible. Use the <a href="https://iatidatastore.iatistandard.org/querybuilder/core-filters">Query Builder</a> to search data across 39 different fields (elements and attributes) of the IATI Standard and choose to download data in three different formats (CSV, XML and JSON). For the more technical user, the <a href="https://iatidatastore.iatistandard.org/documentation">Datastore API</a> enables searches of IATI data across  <strong>all</strong>  elements of the IATI Standard, enabling more complex data analysis.</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://iatistandard.org/media/images/IATI_Datastore_Query_Builder.width-700.png" title="IATI Datastore Query Builder launch.png|autoxauto"><img src="https://iatistandard.org/media/images/IATI_Datastore_Query_Builder.width-700.png" alt="IATI Datastore Query Builder launch.png|autoxauto" width="676" height="500"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">IATI Datastore Query Builder launch.png|autoxauto</span><span class="informations">700×517</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>
<p>Use the Query Builder to search for development and humanitarian activities responding to COVID-19</p>
<p>The Query Builder and API also provide users with data that complies with the most up-to-date version of the IATI Standard (version 2 and beyond). The IATI Datastore complements existing online tools for accessing IATI data such as <a href="http://d-portal.org/ctrack.html#view=search">d-portal</a>.</p>
<h3>Why use the new IATI Validator?</h3>
<p>Organisations are strongly encouraged to use the new IATI Validator to check if their data is accessible and of good quality, increasing its utility for partner countries, civil society and other data users. Organisations have the option of <a href="https://iativalidator.iatistandard.org/validate">checking for errors in their data  <em>before</em>  publishing their files</a>, or  <em>after</em>  data has been published (<a href="https://iativalidator.iatistandard.org/organisations">using the Public Data Viewer</a>).</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://iatistandard.org/media/images/IATI_Validator_launch.width-700.png" title="IATI Validator launch.png|autoxauto"><img src="https://iatistandard.org/media/images/IATI_Validator_launch.width-700.png" alt="IATI Validator launch.png|autoxauto" width="690" height="363"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">IATI Validator launch.png|autoxauto</span><span class="informations">700×369</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>
<p>Use the new <a href="https://iativalidator.iatistandard.org/">IATI Validator</a> to check the quality of IATI data.</p>
<p>Most organisations will find at least some errors in their data and we know this may take some time for them to correct. IATI’s Secretariat is providing support in the following ways to help organisations make these changes to improve the quality of their data.</p>
<h3>Get support: online guidance and webinars</h3>
<p>The IATI Secretariat has provided instructions and useful information on both tools through online guidance: <a href="https://iatistandard.org/documents/10453/IATI_Datastore_Query_Builder_User_Guide.pdf">IATI Datastore Query Builder User Guide</a>, <a href="https://iatidatastore.iatistandard.org/documentation">IATI Datastore API documentation</a> and the <a href="https://iatistandard.org/documents/10454/IATI_Validator_QA_September_2020.pdf">IATI Validator Q&amp;A</a>. The Secretariat will also be proactively contacting IATI publishers in the coming months to offer direct support to improve their datafiles using the IATI Validator.</p>
<p>You can learn how to make the most of both tools by joining upcoming webinars held by IATI’s Technical Team:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Webinar: Using IATI’s new Validator, Wednesday 7 October</strong>  <a href="https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJcof-GhqjkrEtOQfRStOf1mTknhe_yguTkj"> <strong>Register</strong> </a>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Webinar: Using IATI’s new Datastore, Wednesday 28 October</strong>  <a href="https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJIrduqpqzMuHtLCjFMrqiBt5HM3HUBRU0GG"> <strong>Register</strong> </a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, the IATI Technical Team welcomes your questions and feedback at: <a href="mailto:support@iatistandard.org">support@iatistandard.org</a>.</p>
<h3>What’s changed since the testing phase?</h3>
<p>The new Datastore and Validator were pre-released for extensive testing. Both have benefitted from a huge number of improvements in response to feedback from IATI’s community of data users and publishers. Here are just a few examples:</p>
<p><strong>Datastore</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Additional filters have been added to the Datastore Query Builder</li>
<li>Users can now output CSV columns in the order of the IATI XML Schema</li>
<li>The Query Builder has a new multi-sector and multi-country expansion option</li>
<li>The Datastore is now integrated with the Validator. This means that the Validator will check that data is fed into the Datastore and ensure only data that follows the IATI schema is available to users. The IATI schema provides the exact order and structure for publishing the XML. Data that does not follow the IATI XML schema will not be outputted through the Datastore. For further information see <a href="https://iatistandard.org/documents/10454/IATI_Validator_QA_September_2020.pdf">IATI Validator Q&amp;A</a> (page 5-6).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Validator</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All bugs raised by users following the testing phase have been fixed</li>
<li>There is a new feature to allow the bulk-uploading of files</li>
<li>Users can now receive validation reports via email.</li>
</ul>
<p>The IATI Technical Team has worked with suppliers <a href="https://zimmerman.team/">Zimmerman</a> (who continue to host the new IATI Datastore) and <a href="https://data4development.nl/en/">Data4Development</a> (developers of the new IATI Validator, now hosted by the IATI Secretariat) to implement changes to both products.</p>
<h3>Important: Deprecation of old Datastore and Public Validator - 22 March 2021</h3>
<p>As previously announced, the new IATI Datastore and Validator replace the old Datastore CSV Query Builder, API and Public Validator. These older versions will be deprecated on Monday 22 March 2021 and after this date, users will no longer be able to access these services.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Old Datastore API:</strong>  Between now and 22 March 2021 users can choose to  <em>either</em>  use existing API calls to return data from the old Datastore,  <em>or</em>  use a Redirect version from the Old Datastore to the new Datastore. Redirects can be tested by replacing “<a href="http://datastore.iatistandard.org">datastore.iatistandard.org</a>” in previous queries with “<a href="http://datastoreredirect.iatistandard.org">datastoreredirect.iatistandard.org</a>.” By using this version, existing API calls will be redirected and return data from the new Datastore. After 22 March 2021, the old Datastore will be deprecated and  <strong>all</strong>  queries to the Old Datastore will automatically be redirected to corresponding queries on the new Datastore.</li>
</ul>
<p>For any questions or support to transition to using the new Datastore and Validator, please email the IATI Secretariat: <a href="mailto:support@iatistandard.org">support@iatistandard.org</a>.</p>
<h3>Upcoming work</h3>
<p>IATI’s Secretariat is committed to maintaining and updating all IATI digital products to meet users’ needs. Some examples of planned work include:</p>
<p><strong>Datastore:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Enable transaction and activity level data to be output from a single query</li>
<li>Enable output of normalised USD values for transactions, regardless of published currency</li>
<li>Enable output of validation results.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Validator:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Key priority post-launch is working proactively with publishers in fixing data errors and improving their data quality.</li>
</ul>
<p>To provide feedback on either of these two projects, please raise an issue on Github: <a href="https://github.com/zimmerman-team/iati.cloud/issues">IATI Datastore</a> <a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Validator-Web">Validator</a> or email <a href="mailto:support@iatistandard.org">support@iatistandard.org</a></p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The IATI Technical Team has written process guidance on how to make changes to the <a href="https://iatistandard.org/en/guidance/standard-guidance/">IATI Standard Publishing Guidance pages</a>. Please note that this is a new process and we will monitoring how it works and will revisit this after one year of application. On suggested use of platform, such as Github and Discuss, we will of course also look into how we can use the new IATI community platform once set in place.</p>
<p>In the process of writing this guidance, we looked at <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xjlAneqgewZvHh6_hwuQ98hbjxRcA2IUqOTJiNGcOf8/edit#heading=h.irnq91ktnkzz">Open Contracting Guidance</a> to see how others have approached similar process; we also discussed this with IATI Governing Board Focal Points Melinda Cuzner and Leo Stolk.</p>
<p>We would like to share the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mfbj1HlGavi1AU0nJSJVwxx5_j0lXB8dwV8EiSURvWw/edit#heading=h.s5ha71xbo7cp">IATI Standard Publishing Guidance - How to Make Changes document</a> with you in advance to make sure it is clear and straightforward. Please respond to this thread by  <strong>Friday 2 October</strong>  if you have clarification comments and we will make sure we address them. We will then publish this on our main website and link to it from the IATI Publishing Guidance pages as well.</p>

            <p>HI everyone</p>
<p>Thanks to d-portal, I noticed that there are 25,742 activities that have an SDG target or goal at the <code>tag</code> element</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/original/1X/ccb93482e72ac348979596122184d95e97aa42f8.jpeg" data-download-href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/ccb93482e72ac348979596122184d95e97aa42f8" title="d-portal"><img src="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/ccb93482e72ac348979596122184d95e97aa42f8_2_690x373.jpeg" alt="d-portal" data-base62-sha1="td4cECE5yZXNZDumYJcyjGVR5qM" width="690" height="373" srcset="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/ccb93482e72ac348979596122184d95e97aa42f8_2_690x373.jpeg, https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/ccb93482e72ac348979596122184d95e97aa42f8_2_1035x559.jpeg 1.5x, https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/ccb93482e72ac348979596122184d95e97aa42f8_2_1380x746.jpeg 2x" data-small-upload="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/ccb93482e72ac348979596122184d95e97aa42f8_2_10x10.png"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">d-portal</span><span class="informations">1982×1074 329 KB</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>
<p>d-portal also shows me that these activities are provided by 14 IATI publishers:</p>

<p>And - you guessed it - <a href="http://d-portal.org/ctrack.html?/tag@vocabulary=2%2C3#view=list_publishers" rel="nofollow noopener">d-portal then lets me see who these are</a>:</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/original/1X/4aa2b61d0ac58f3417b0cfef878ea1d205581b06.png" data-download-href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/4aa2b61d0ac58f3417b0cfef878ea1d205581b06" title="d-portal (2)"><img src="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/4aa2b61d0ac58f3417b0cfef878ea1d205581b06_2_690x460.png" alt="d-portal (2)" data-base62-sha1="aEfWiEZHTMnLj532SXE0nfhp5bw" width="690" height="460" srcset="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/4aa2b61d0ac58f3417b0cfef878ea1d205581b06_2_690x460.png, https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/4aa2b61d0ac58f3417b0cfef878ea1d205581b06_2_1035x690.png 1.5x, https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/4aa2b61d0ac58f3417b0cfef878ea1d205581b06_2_1380x920.png 2x" data-small-upload="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/4aa2b61d0ac58f3417b0cfef878ea1d205581b06_2_10x10.png"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">d-portal (2)</span><span class="informations">1940×1294 588 KB</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>
<p>So - it’s good to see some usage.</p>
<p>However, does this match the user needs that drove the initial need to <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/update-from-the-sdg-working-group-draft-guidance-available-for-review/1783">produce focused guidance</a> on SDGs?</p>
<p>The number of publishers seem particularly low, vis-a-vis those that engaged in that whole process.</p>
<p>Should we expect more?  Has anyone attempted to use this data?  What can it tell us?</p>
<p>Look forward to any thoughts or insights!</p>

          <title>COVID-19 prototype visualisation updates</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[markbrough]]></dc:creator>
          <category>COVID-19</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I hope everyone is doing OK during these difficult times!</p>
<p>On behalf of the <a href="https://interagencystandingcommittee.org/greater-transparency" rel="nofollow noopener">Grand Bargain transparency workstream</a>, we have made some further improvements to <a href="https://covid19.humportal.org/activities/" rel="nofollow noopener">the COVID-19 prototype visualisation</a> (see <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/new-covid-19-funding-data-visualisation-launched/1969">original post here</a>) and wanted to share these with the IATI community.</p>
<p>The number of COVID-19 activities has now significantly increased to over 5000 – the visualisation now automatically updates every hour.</p>
<p>We’ve recently added the following additional functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>summarise by commitments or disbursements</li>
<li>breakdown by reporting organisation, country or sector</li>
<li>filter by sector</li>
<li>download transactions in Excel, expanded out by country and sector (e.g. where a single transaction relates to multiple countries or sectors) - allowing for detailed analysis</li>
<li>share / save the current view based on selected filters (the URL is now updated)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>(NB most of the improvements refer to the <strong>activities</strong> tab, which uses IATI data)</em></p>
<p>I wanted to talk through some of this work and ask for feedback from the IATI community regarding whether this is a good way of reprocessing and presenting the data.</p>

<h2>Summarising by commitments / disbursements</h2>

<em><a href="https://covid19.humportal.org/activities/?country=LR&amp;summary=commitments" rel="nofollow noopener">Total commitments for activities in Liberia, by reporting organisation</a></em></p>
<p>Initially, we just showed a list of projects, with a summary at the top showing the <a href="https://covid19.humportal.org/activities" rel="nofollow noopener">number of activities</a> for each reporting organisation or country. We added new functionality to roll up by <a href="https://covid19.humportal.org/activities?summary=commitments" rel="nofollow noopener">commitments</a> or <a href="https://covid19.humportal.org/activities?summary=disbursements" rel="nofollow noopener">disbursements</a>. In order to do this, we had to undertake some reprocessing of the data:</p>
<ul>
<li>all values are converted to USD according to the <code>value-date</code>, <a href="https://exchangerates.codeforiati.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">using this dataset</a> (with rates sourced from the OECD and Federal Reserve)</li>
<li>where there are multiple sectors or countries on an activity, transactions are broken down into multiple rows for each sector/country, with the transaction value proportionate to the sector/country percentages.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/markbrough/covid19-data/blob/gh-pages/xlsx/traceability/transactions_sectors_countries_regions.xlsx?raw=true" rel="nofollow noopener">resulting data is available in Excel here</a>, in case you want to take a look.</p>
<h3>Double-counting</h3>
<p><img src="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/original/1X/ccd933136de6a6abf4afea29a1258ca270ca9a6f.png" alt="image|660x5075" data-base62-sha1="teaKBRQlAZo0MsgB9kNuBRZCyaX" width="660" height="50"><br>
<em>Warning if results are likely to contain double-counting</em></p>
<p>We don’t currently handle double-counting in this dataset or visualisation, other than to alert the user when there is a risk of double-counting. However, there are a few ideas about how this could be handled:</p>
<ul>
<li>allow / encourage users to select to view only a particular type of organisation
<ul>
<li>e.g. there is less likely to be double-counting when looking only at Governments, though there will still be some double-counting in cases of delegated cooperation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>show net disbursements instead of disbursements and net commitments instead of commitments
<ul>
<li>i.e. disbursements MINUS incoming funds and commitments MINUS incoming commitments</li>
<li>however, this will only work where organisations are reporting incoming funds; many large organisations are not doing so.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>comparing organisation IDs or (harder!) organisation names – e.g. if Germany is disbursing to UNDP, we could try to subtract that amount from UNDP’s total
<ul>
<li>this could get a bit messy!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We would be very keen to hear if anyone has suggestions on the best way to proceed here!</p>

<h2>Sectors</h2>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/original/1X/da2cd1d843969888983e28afe6774fa018b3c291.png" data-download-href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/da2cd1d843969888983e28afe6774fa018b3c291" title="image"><img src="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/da2cd1d843969888983e28afe6774fa018b3c291_2_517x239.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="v8475vlW4F54A6zcHtnXlEecM6t" width="517" height="239" srcset="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/da2cd1d843969888983e28afe6774fa018b3c291_2_517x239.png, https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/da2cd1d843969888983e28afe6774fa018b3c291_2_775x358.png 1.5x, https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/da2cd1d843969888983e28afe6774fa018b3c291_2_1034x478.png 2x" data-small-upload="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/da2cd1d843969888983e28afe6774fa018b3c291_2_10x10.png"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">image</span><span class="informations">1105×512 57.2 KB</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div><br>
<em><a href="https://covid19.humportal.org/activities/?summary=commitments&amp;breakdown=sector" rel="nofollow noopener">Total commitments by sector</a></em></p>
<p>It’s also now possible to summarise the data by sectors (we are only using the DAC codes here). Again, as shown in the image above, this summary may currently lead to double counting where more than one reporting organisation is included.</p>
<p>Perhaps it would be useful to be able to summarise by multiple sectors, and to select whole categories at once (e.g. all health or education sectors) – any other preferences?</p>
<hr>
<h2>Downloads</h2>
<p>We have added a series of additional download options. On the activities tab, the blue download button now allow you to download <a href="https://github.com/markbrough/covid19-data/blob/gh-pages/traceability/transactions_sectors_countries_regions.xlsx?raw=true" rel="nofollow noopener">transactions broken down by sector and country/region</a>. For this dataset, an additional column has been added (<code>value_USD_proportionate</code>) which makes it easy to put a pivot table on top of the dataset. This column is calculated by multiplying the <code>value_USD</code> column by the proportion allocated to this sector and this country/region.</p>
<p>For example: a transaction for USD 100, allocated 40% health and 60% education; 50% to Kenya and 50% to Uganda would be output as:</p>
<div class="md-table">
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>value_USD</th>
<th>sector</th>
<th>country_region</th>
<th>value_USD_proportionate</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>health</td>
<td>Kenya</td>
<td>20</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>health</td>
<td>Uganda</td>
<td>20</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>education</td>
<td>Kenya</td>
<td>30</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>education</td>
<td>Uganda</td>
<td>30</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div><p>In the dataset, the <code>sector</code> and <code>country_region</code> are output with the relevant sector or country codes, rather than the full sector/country names, in order to reduce the filesize.</p>

<h2>Other plans and feedback</h2>
<p>We are working on a few more improvements to the visualisation at the moment, for example to include the ability to filter by grant or loan. We’d be very keen to hear from anyone who might have further suggestions on how we could best present this data.</p>
<p>You are very welcome to add feedback here, or alternatively email us at: <a href="mailto:humportal@devinit.org">humportal@devinit.org</a></p>

<p>Really interesting to see reliefweb using the GLIDE code as the page ref for the disaster.</p>
<p>Not sure what the HRP code is so if anyone has it, please share here.</p>

          <title>[Approved] New Organisation Identifier: XI-IATI-KHF</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[amys]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Non-Core Codelist Amendments</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The following addition to the IATI Organisation Identifier list has been proposed for The King Hussein Foundation (KHF).</p>
<p>The organisation was established in Jordan, 1999 to serve as an enduring commitment to His Majesty King Hussein’s humanitarian vision and legacy. Due to this special circumstance, they are not registered via a recognised <a href="http://org-id.guide/results?structure=all&amp;coverage=JO&amp;sector=all">registration agency</a> and using tax codes are not sufficient. The XI-IATI identifier has been pursued.</p>
<p><strong>Code:</strong>  XI-IATI-KHF</p>
<p><strong>Name:</strong>  The King Hussein Foundation (KHF)</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong>  Their mission is to build upon King Hussein’s lifelong commitment to peace, sustainable community development and cross-cultural understanding through national and regional programs that promote education and leadership, economic empowerment and participatory decision-making.</p>
<p><strong>URL:</strong>  <a href="http://www.kinghusseinfoundation.org/">http://www.kinghusseinfoundation.org/</a></p>
<p>If no objection is received this XI-IATI code will be approved and added in a week.</p>

          <title>Datastore Project Update: August 2020</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[IATI-techteam]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Notifications</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Zimmerman and the IATI Secretariat are pleased to provide an update on the progress of the IATI Datastore project.</p>
<p>Over the last few months we have worked intensively to make a huge number of improvements to the tool, in response to community feedback during the testing phase, and to satisfy remaining requirements from the TOR. We’ve fixed bugs and added the required enhancements that enable the tool to be as robust and dependable as possible. We are working towards a release date of 22nd September.</p>
<p><strong>What work has been completed?</strong></p>
<p>A non-exhaustive list of these items include:</p>
<p>Bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>0.00 values not being output</li>
<li>‘Default’ elements being farmed to transactions</li>
<li>Location output not matching published data</li>
<li>Multiple description types not output</li>
</ul>
<p>Functional Additions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Validator Integration</li>
<li>Schema-valid XML output</li>
<li>Several additional filters</li>
<li>Streamlined parsing process</li>
<li>Output CSV columns in Schema order</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Remaining Requirements and official launch</strong></p>
<p>As existing users will know, all items mentioned above have been implemented and are available to use now.</p>
<p>The only remaining requirement for the product to be fully launched is for sector and recipient-country expansion functionality to be added to the csv output. Sector and recipient-country expansion allows, if required by the user, the ability to repeat each activity or transaction (depending on the row-output choice) over multiple rows, for each sector or recipient-country that is reported.</p>
<p>The core functionality is already available on the tool, but the Zimmerman team is now working to make this available for all filters, and ensuring that all fields can be returned, as required.</p>
<p>Once the work on the sector and recipient-country expansion feature is completed, the tool will be ready for launch. The purpose of the launch is to actively promote the use of the IATI Datastore both to existing and new IATI stakeholders within the international development and humanitarian sectors. A comprehensive User Guide for the Query Builder will also be published at the time of launch.</p>
<p><strong>Redirects</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned on a previous <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/iati-datastore-redirects-testing/1970">Discuss post</a>, an important requirement is that queries that are made to the ‘old’ IATI Datastore API are redirected to the new one, with the equivalent query parameters used. This will ensure that any regular queries that utilise the existing tool can continue to return corresponding data from the new tool.</p>
<p>The timeline for deprecating the old Datastore and implementing the redirects is as follows:</p>
<p>From New Datastore communications Launch until 6 months after:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://datastore.iatistandard.org/query/">Old Datastore</a> remains live, as is.</li>
<li>“Redirect version” of Old Datastore is also available for use. The “Redirect version” of the Old Datastore will provide users with the corresponding query to the New Datastore. This should help with any migrations before the Old Datastore is deprecated</li>
</ul>
<p>6 months after Datastore official launch</p>
<ul>
<li>Old Datastore is deprecated and no longer available</li>
<li>“Redirect version” of Old Datastore is deprecated and no longer available</li>
<li>Any queries to the Old Datastore <strong>automatically</strong> redirect to a corresponding query on the new Datastore.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Post Launch Requirements</strong></p>
<p>Following the launch, we will continue to work on implementing the following requirements previously identified and keep the Community updated as to when these will be released .</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow elements that can be returned at either transaction or activity level to be returned within the same query - <a href="https://github.com/zimmerman-zimmerman/iati.cloud/issues/2081">#2081</a>
</li>
<li>Add aggregated transaction data to the activity output - <a href="https://github.com/zimmerman-zimmerman/iati.cloud/issues/2025">#2025</a>
</li>
<li>Allow the user to choose between basic, complete, or custom csv output - <a href="https://github.com/zimmerman-zimmerman/iati.cloud/issues/2295">#2295</a>
</li>
<li>Normalise transaction values to USD - <a href="https://github.com/zimmerman-zimmerman/iati.cloud/issues/2219">#2219</a>
</li>
<li>Enable return of Validation results from the Datastore - <a href="https://github.com/zimmerman-zimmerman/iati.cloud/issues/2296">#2296</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As with all of our services, the IATI Secretariat will continue to monitor and respond to user needs with any necessary updates in the future, and will undertake consultations with the wider IATI Community about potential changes to the datastore and validator integration, including on topics currently under review <a href="https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscuss.iatistandard.org%2Ft%2Fiati-datastore-what-data-should-go-in%2F1631%2F60&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cannelise.parr%40undp.org%7C265f99d70f7b41a1a25108d83882e69e%7Cb3e5db5e2944483799f57488ace54319%7C0%7C0%7C637321482149473130&amp;sdata=97y7HQbUV5a4JEbPHjcLUVXIWFD%2FqGIAodm4z1rJvI0%3D&amp;reserved=0">on Discuss.</a></p>

          <title>Region codelist is out-of-date (from OECD DAC source)</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[stevieflow]]></dc:creator>
          <category>IATI Standard</category>

            <p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/iati-techteam">@IATI-techteam</a></p>
<p>The Region codelist seems out-of-date with the OECD DAC source.  There seem to be <a href="https://codelists.codeforiati.org/Region/" rel="nofollow noopener">nine new regional codes available</a>, which might be useful to publishers.</p>
<p>I can see that the <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/making-codelists-more-accessible/1895">community-run codelist</a> was updated on <a href="https://github.com/codeforIATI/IATI-Codelists-NonEmbedded/commits/master/xml/Region.xml" rel="nofollow noopener">13th April</a>, as the codelist “bot” identified an update to the OECD DAC source.</p>
<p>It’d be great to know the timescales for the central IATI documentation to follow this.  I had understood similar automations were already in place.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

          <title>IATI datastore not updating and previewer down?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[matmaxgeds]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Welcome to IATI Discuss</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi, I was looking up an  project this morning for COVID in Palestine this morning and:</p>
<ol>
<li>I am not sure that the datastore is up to date at the moment, <a href="https://d-portal.org/ctrack.html?text_search=covid&amp;country_code=PS#view=act&amp;aid=XI-IATI-EC_FPI-2020%2F42819%2F0" rel="nofollow noopener">here is a project that I can find in d-portal</a>, but I can’t find it in the datastore <a href="http://datastore.iatistandard.org/api/1/access/activity.xml?iati-identifier=XI-IATI-EC_FPI-2020/42819/0" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a> or <a href="http://datastore.iatistandard.org/api/1/access/activity.csv?reporting-org=XI-IATI-EC_DEVCO&amp;recipient-country=PS&amp;start-date__gt=2020-12-31" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>? Any ideas?</li>
<li>The previewer for the datastore <a href="http://preview.iatistandard.org/index.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdatastore.iatistandard.org%2Fapi%2F1%2Faccess%2Factivity.xml%3Freporting-org%3DXI-IATI-EC_DEVCO%26recipient-country%3DPS%26start-date__gt%3D2020-12-31" rel="nofollow noopener">doesn’t seem to be working</a> with datastore data - any ideas on that one? Edit…maybe it never worked and I am confused, but in that case seems worth quickly removing the link?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks!</p>

          <title>Moving IATI Standard content from IATI reference site to main IATI website</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[IATI-techteam]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Notifications</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>This post provides an update on the work to migrate IATI Standard content from IATI’s old Reference site (now available <a href="http://archivereference.iatistandard.org/">here</a>) to <a href="http://iatistandard.org">iatistandard.org</a> as announced in our <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/technical-notice-moving-iati-standard-content-from-iati-reference-site-to-main-iati-website/1897/14">previous posts</a>. Many thanks to all the feedback from the community on this project.</p>
<p><strong>What changes have been made?</strong></p>
<p>IATI’s website has been updated to include information on the rules and guidance of the IATI Standard. Content previously held on IATI’s old <a href="http://archivereference.iatistandard.org/">Reference site</a> has been added to <a href="http://iatistandard.org">iatistandard.org</a>, ensuring all information about the IATI Standard can be easily accessed in one place.</p>
<p><strong>All IATI Standard information now on <a href="http://iatistandard.org">iatistandard.org</a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Technical documentation on all components of the IATI Standard (elements, attributes, rulesets, upgrades etc.) can be found in the <a href="http://iatistandard.org/en/iati-standard/">IATI Standard section</a> of this website. Do note, as the IATI Standard version 1 was deprecated in 2019, all version 1 pages are kept as an archive within this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All guidance material (including setting up IATI accounts, how to publish data, Standard guidance and developer documentation) can be found in the <a href="https://iatistandard.org/en/guidance/">Guidance and Support</a> section of the website.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Old IATI Reference site</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The old IATI Reference site has been archived and will be turned off in 6 months time on 3 February 2020.</li>
<li>However, from today users who access old links to the IATI Reference site, will be redirected to the new pages on <a href="http://iatistandard.org">iatistandard.org</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Users should note that no information on the IATI Standard that has been migrated from the old IATI Reference site has changed, however it has been reordered and re-structured on <a href="http://iatistandard.org">iatistandard.org</a>. Updates have been made to content in the Guidance section of <a href="http://iatistandard.org">iatistandard.org</a>, following consultations with the community. These changes will make it easier and more streamlined for publishers and data users to find and understand information about the IATI Standard.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Technical changes: IATI - GitHub</strong></p>
<p>There have also been a few behind-the-scenes changes on <a href="https://github.com/IATI">IATI-GitHub</a> to provide more flexibility in how the Secretariat can use and display IATI Standard content.</p>
<p><strong>Changes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>From IATI/Extra-Documentation we have moved:</p>
<ul>
<li>The updated overview pages to the IATI/Guidance repository</li>
<li>The codelist-api.rst page now sits within IATI/Developer-Documentation</li>
<li>The codelist-management.rst page sits within IATI/Upgrades</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>From IATI/Guidance we have moved:</p>
<ul>
<li>The old datastore documentation to the IATI/Developer Documentation repository</li>
<li>The old introduction pages have been archived as these are now contained within Wagtail CMS as per the first website launch</li>
<li>The IATI upgrade pages to the IATI/Upgrades repository.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These changes provide the Technical Team with the required level of version control for each page type. For example, we only need one copy of each IATI standard upgrade page. These pages do not differ between the IATI versions.</p>
<p><strong>Next steps</strong></p>
<p>In the coming months we will continue to undertake formatting fixes and optimisations on <a href="http://iatistandard.org">iatistandard.org</a>. These will happen both on the website and behind the scenes.</p>
<p>We’re committed to listening to any feedback so please email any questions about these changes to <a href="mailto:support@iatistandard.org">support@iatistandard.org</a>.</p>

          <title>Best Practices - Aid Type and Grand Bargain</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Michelle_IOM]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Using IATI Data</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>Hoping to crowd source some ideas on best practices.  Apologies if this has been discussed before but I didn’t see it in previous discussions but admittedly I’m crap at finding old threads.  If I missed it don’t hesitate to point me to it.</p>
<p>There are AidType vocabulary for both OECD and Grand Bargain (GB) and from what I can tell  you can code the same activity (default level) or transaction (transaction level) against both.</p>
<p>Assuming that a publisher is:</p>
<ol>
<li>receiving money from a donor</li>
<li>is not passing it on to an implementing partner</li>
<li>coding at the transaction not activity level</li>
</ol>
<p>Questions, is it correct to assume:</p>
<ol>
<li>that codes 1-3 would only be used for incoming commitment (transaction type 11) or incoming funds (transaction type 1)</li>
<li>code 4 would be for expenditures?</li>
<li>is it best practice to code both transaction types 1 and 11 with aid types 1-3 or would it only be for the incoming commitment?</li>
</ol>
<p>Rather than replicating AidTypes in two different transaction types, it could simply be coded at the activity level.  But if these 3 vocabularies are only related to two transaction types won’t that mess up assumptions on the disbursement (3) and Expenditure (4) transaction types?</p>
<p>In looking at the list of GB signatories, only a handful actually code to the GB aid type vocabulary 2-4 so perhaps <a class="mention" href="/u/stolk">@stolk</a>, <a class="mention" href="/u/pelleaardema">@pelleaardema</a>, <a class="mention" href="/u/stevieflow">@stevieflow</a> can chime in here as they work for/with a few of them.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.<br>

          <title>[Approved]New Organisation Identifier: XI-IATI-WVDRC</title>

          <category>Non-Core Codelist Amendments</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The following addition to the IATI Organisation Identifier list has been proposed for World Vision’s DRC Office.</p>
<p>Due to their publishing time-frame and that there are currently <a href="https://github.com/org-id/register/issues/292">no registrars which offer stable identifiers in DRC</a>, the XI-IATI identifier has been pursued.</p>
<p><strong>Code:</strong>  XI-IATI-WVDRC<br>
<strong>Name:</strong> World Vision DRC<br>
<strong>Description:</strong>  Our teams have been working in the DRC since 1984. Today, we are working to contribute to the measurable and sustainable improvement of well-being for 5,311,208 children and their communities through transformational development and humanitarian relief programmes focused on: health and nutrition, education, water and sanitation, protecting children, livelihoods and resilience, food aid, psychosocial support and the reintegration if displaced people.<br>
<strong>URL:</strong>  <a href="https://www.wvi.org/congo-drc/about-us">https://www.wvi.org/congo-drc/about-us</a></p>
<p>If no objection is received this XI-IATI code will be approved and added in a week.</p>
