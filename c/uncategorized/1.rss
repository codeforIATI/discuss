            <p><strong>IATI are seeking a UX Researcher to understand more about IATI publishers and the functionality they require as they publish to IATI.</strong></p>
<p>The IATI Governing Board has asked the Secretariat to conduct an options analysis to assess potential approaches to a publishing tool. While we have already learned a great deal about our diverse community of more than 1,200 publishers of different types and sizes, we need to understand more about our publishers and the functionality they require as they publish to IATI. This will enable us to analyse options for a publishing tool based on publisher input. All sizes of publishing organisations should be consulted as part of this exercise.</p>
<p>For more information, please see the <a href="https://devinit.org/work-for-us/vacancies/independent-consultant-ux-researcher-iati/">specific requirements and deliverables on this page</a>. Please share with your networks!</p>

          <title>Reverso validator?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[matmaxgeds]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Welcome to IATI Discuss</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi - would it be possible to have the validator return a list of all the ‘errors’ in IATI data, and then e.g. the number of cases for each one (grouped by error, not by the datafile)? I think the validator stores runs tests on the data in the background so this might be feasible? Or maybe it would be a specific job that looped through all the files - perhaps possible via the validator API?</p>

            <p>Hi, I was looking up an  project this morning for COVID in Palestine this morning and:</p>
<ol>
<li>I am not sure that the datastore is up to date at the moment, <a href="https://d-portal.org/ctrack.html?text_search=covid&amp;country_code=PS#view=act&amp;aid=XI-IATI-EC_FPI-2020%2F42819%2F0" rel="nofollow noopener">here is a project that I can find in d-portal</a>, but I can’t find it in the datastore <a href="http://datastore.iatistandard.org/api/1/access/activity.xml?iati-identifier=XI-IATI-EC_FPI-2020/42819/0" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a> or <a href="http://datastore.iatistandard.org/api/1/access/activity.csv?reporting-org=XI-IATI-EC_DEVCO&amp;recipient-country=PS&amp;start-date__gt=2020-12-31" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>? Any ideas?</li>
<li>The previewer for the datastore <a href="http://preview.iatistandard.org/index.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdatastore.iatistandard.org%2Fapi%2F1%2Faccess%2Factivity.xml%3Freporting-org%3DXI-IATI-EC_DEVCO%26recipient-country%3DPS%26start-date__gt%3D2020-12-31" rel="nofollow noopener">doesn’t seem to be working</a> with datastore data - any ideas on that one? Edit…maybe it never worked and I am confused, but in that case seems worth quickly removing the link?</li>

          <title>Element in org file for (optionally) including 98/99 codelists</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[matmaxgeds]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Welcome to IATI Discuss</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Stimulated by the discussions on using 99 vocabs for COVID…when publishers use a 98/99 vocab:</p>
<ol>
<li>If that codelist is not published in IATI xml format it is very difficult for data users to understand the data as they then have to digest pdfs etc - and this is near impossible for ‘systems’ who cannot parse this data automatically</li>
<li>Some publishers may not be setup for hosting the various 99 codelists, or they go missing because the the hosting is not linked to the IATI data that uses it</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, I am wondering if it would be an option to have an element that allows publishers to host 99 vocabs in their org file - that way they are published via the same method as IATI data, and they are available via the normal APIs (and machine readable)</p>

          <title>Changes to Github SSOT repository &amp; developer documentation- please comment by 27 March</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[IATI-techteam]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Welcome to IATI Discuss</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>This post aims to explain the Technical Team’s <strong>final proposal on changing the Github SSOT repositories and developer documentation</strong> (following discussions and considerations of your responses to <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/technical-notice-moving-iati-standard-content-from-iati-reference-site-to-main-iati-website/1897">our initial post</a>). We aim to get <strong>approval from the community</strong> and request that you respond to this post by <strong>Friday 27 March</strong>.</p>
<h2>1. Single Source of Truth (SSOT)</h2>
<p>Currently, in the<a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Standard-SSOT"> SSOT repository on Github</a> we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Codelists</li>
<li>Extra Documentation</li>
<li>Rulesets</li>
<li>Schemas</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>What changes do we want to make to the SSOT Github repository?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Location of files</strong></p>
<p>The changes we want to make refer to specific sections of the Extra Documentation only.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Extra-Documentation/tree/ed119e070cffc5dc1bd85671175de414c79e8c2f/en">Extra Documentation</a> we currently have:</p>
<ul>
<li>

<ul>
<li>Ruleset development</li>

<p>See the <strong>Table</strong> <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CQKf6mCVHUTKIrX7P-8HGF6M3k87JPTYsF4vjK5Zr3w/edit?usp=sharing">Changes to the SSOT- Extra Documentation</a>, detailing specific changes and where files will be relocated to.</p>
<p><strong>Format of files</strong></p>
<p>We had <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/technical-notice-moving-iati-standard-content-from-iati-reference-site-to-main-iati-website/1897/10">initially proposed to change the format</a> of the IATI Guidance and IATI Extra Documentation repositories and were considering changing their content to XML formatting. There were no strong views expressed from the community on IATI Discuss and following discussion with Open Contracting and considering options with other developers, we have decided to keep files in the format they currently are in: RST.</p>
<p>RST is still widely used by data standards organisations for documentation because it is easy to read, easy to version control, and can still contain a robust amount of content and formatting. While XML or JSON would have been more flexible and more machine readable, it would not be human readable, nor would it be easy for the community to version control.</p>
<h3><strong>Why are we making these changes to the SSOT repository?</strong></h3>
<p>The SSOT needs to cover only the prescriptive parts of the Standard and needs to be version controlled for each version of the Standard, e.g 2.01, 2.02, 2.03. The content that we want to move out of the SSOT repository is the descriptive part of the standard, including guidance and explanations. Based on feedback received from the community on how important version control is for the descriptive part of the Standard, we have decided to keep all existing content from Extra Documentation on Github and will simply change the location of the files; it will still be version controlled on Github but only for major versions of the Standard.</p>
<h2>2. Developer Documentation</h2>
<p>In our previous <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/technical-notice-moving-iati-standard-content-from-iati-reference-site-to-main-iati-website/1897">Technical Notice post</a> we have announced that we will be moving the <a href="http://github.com/IATI/IATI-Developer-Documentation/">Developer Documentation</a> to our Content Management System (CMS) Wagtail, meaning it will not be version controlled. We have not received any objection to this from the community so would like to go ahead with that change and wanted to confirm that in this post.</p>
<h2>Get in touch</h2>
<p>Please let us know your views by responding to this post. If you can let us know your views by <strong>next Friday 27 March</strong>, that will be much appreciated!</p>

            <p>The IATI Technical Team will shortly be moving the content of the IATI Standard <a href="http://reference.iatistandard.org/203/activity-standard/">Reference site</a> onto IATI’s main website: <a href="https://iatistandard.org/">iatistandard.org/</a>. This work is being delivered in line with the IATI Workplan Y6 (Sept 2018 - Dec 2019) and IATI Workplan Y7 2020.</p>
<p>This move means that IATI Standard reference information will be accessible on one website, alongside other useful publisher and user content. It will also streamline the Technical Team’s process of updating content, saving valuable time.</p>
<p><strong>What is changing?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The website: <a href="http://reference.iatistandard.org/">reference.iatistandard.org/</a> will be removed and content from this site will be available to users on <a href="https://iatistandard.org/">iatistandard.org/</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>IATI-Guidance GitHub repository removal</strong> - Currently the <a href="http://reference.iatistandard.org/">reference.iatistandard.org/</a> site displays content that is pulled from the <a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Guidance">IATI-Guidance GitHub repository</a>. The IATI-Guidance GitHub repository will be removed and most of its content will be moved to Wagtail, which is the platform for IATI’s main website: <a href="https://iatistandard.org/">iatistandard.org/</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Changelogs moved to IATI-Standard-SSOT GitHub repository</strong> - The only content from the <a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Guidance">IATI-Guidance GitHub repository</a> that will not move to Wagtail is the changelogs. The changelogs will be moved into the <a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Standard-SSOT">IATI-Standard-SSOT repository</a>, where they can continue to be updated in the same way that they have been in the past.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other content to be moved to from GitHub to Wagtail include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Extra-Documentation/">github.com/IATI/IATI-Extra-Documentation/</a> - Only overview pages within this repository will be removed from Github and migrated to Wagtail.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Developer-Documentation/">github.com/IATI/IATI-Developer-Documentation/</a> - Developer documentation to be removed from Github and moved to Wagtail.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Changes to the format of the IATI-Extra-Documentation GitHub repository - please provide your views</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Extra-Documentation">IATI-Extra-Documentation</a> repository will remain on GitHub however the Technical Team proposes to change the way the pages are written (as described below). Currently the Technical Team uses reStructuredText (rst) format, with additional Sphinx markup. However the additional Sphinx markup added to the files can be a nuisance to read as code and can sometimes be confusing for human reading as well.</p>
<p>The Technical Team propose changing the format of these files into one of two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Change the files into JSON format with some embedded Jinja which would link to the example XML files. This would mean it would be easier for developers to obtain the Extra-Documentation content from the repository, and it would correspond with the format that is used by the IATI-Standard-Website.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change the Extra-Documentation repository into XML formatted files. This would enable developers to easily read and convert the documentation to the required formats, whilst also remaining in a familiar and readable format, allowing for easy generation or amendment of content as necessary.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Feedback required:</strong> <em>Please provide your preferred option or any other comments about this proposal by responding to this post or emailing: <a href="mailto:support@iatistandard.org">support@iatistandard.org</a>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Do note</strong>: that the Technical Team will keep sphinx branches in the IATI-Extra-Documentation GitHub repository after the format switch is made. If you wish to keep using them in that format, only a branch switch will be required. However if you wish to use the new format, your work will have to adapt to include them.</p>
<p><strong>What is not changing?</strong></p>
<p>The following content will be accessible on <a href="http://iatistandard.org">iatistandard.org</a> but will remain on Github and not be moved to Wagtail:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Codelists/tree/version-2.03">IATI-Codelists</a> + <a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Codelists-NonEmbedded/">IATI-Codelists-NonEmbedded</a>. Content will remain as is in the Github repository, management process for content of codelists still follows.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Extra-Documentation/blob/version-2.03/en/codelists-guides/codelist-management.rst">IATI-Extra-Documentation Codelist management</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Rulesets/tree/version-2.03">github.com/IATI/IATI-Rulesets</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Schemas/tree/version-2.03">github.com/IATI/IATI-Schemas</a></li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Extra-Documentation">github.com/IATI/IATI-Extra-Documentation</a> Excluding overview pages (which is moving to Wagtail, as mentioned above), everything will remain in the Github repository.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Who will be affected by these changes? Should I do anything to prepare?</strong></p>
<p>Developers who pull guidance content from Github repositories into their own platforms may be affected. If a developer has concerns about the content in the Github repositories that will be moved to Wagtail, please contact the IATI Technical Team: <a href="mailto:support@iatistandard.org">support@iatistandard.org</a>.</p>
<p>If you are not constantly creating guidance pages from the content of the IATI-Guidance or IATI-Extra-Documentation repositories, there’s nothing to prepare for.</p>
<p><strong>Should I be aware of any potential difficulties with these changes?</strong></p>
<p>After IATI Standard guidance moves from <a href="http://reference.iatistandard.org/">reference.iatistandard.org/</a> to <a href="https://iatistandard.org/">iatistandard.org/</a>, users will no longer be able to access new changes made to the content. Only changelogs will keep a record of new changes, and users will find the changelogs in the <a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Standard-SSOT">IATI-Standard-SSOT GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Will historic GitHub content be accessible to users?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, historic content will still be available to users, as Github keeps control of commits over time.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be French translations of the content moving from the IATI reference site to <a href="http://iatistandard.org">iatistandard.org</a>?</strong></p>
<p>The following content will be translated into French:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://reference.iatistandard.org/203/organisation-standard/overview/">Overview pages: Organisation Standard</a></li>
<li><a href="http://reference.iatistandard.org/203/activity-standard/">Overview pages: Activity Standard</a></li>
<li>
<a href="http://reference.iatistandard.org/203/codelists/">Codelists </a>- The majority of codelists are already translated into French (They were translated in French in April 2018 with the support of the Government of Canada. Please note that if any codelists have been added since then, they may not be available in French.)</li>
<li><a href="http://reference.iatistandard.org/203/namespaces-extensions/">Namespaces and extensions </a></li>
</ul>
<p>The following content will be automatically generated from the <a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Standard-SSOT">IATI single source of truth</a>, and will remain in English only:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Schemas/tree/9119bb5fa7d042d81f6cbac9a20970350b723272">Schemas</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Rulesets/tree/d49b82b821e7ed23d62da1a6767d9dd7cdd310b6">Rulesets</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Extra-Documentation/tree/ed119e070cffc5dc1bd85671175de414c79e8c2f">Extra-Documentation</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When will these changes happen?</strong></p>
<p>The proposed changes are scheduled to be implemented in early March. Github repositories deletion will only occur once the guidance is moved and deployed to <a href="http://iatistandard.org">iatistandard.org</a></p>
<p><strong>Get in touch</strong></p>
<p>If you have any questions about these changes please email <a href="mailto:support@iatistandard.org">support@iatistandard.org</a> or post a comment below.</p>
<p>Many thanks,<br>

          <title>Data retention on the Data Store</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[siemvaessen]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Welcome to IATI Discuss</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The Data Store depends on whatever is available on the IATI Registry. We have come across a use-case with <a class="mention" href="/u/wendy">@Wendy</a> on the Humanitarian Data Portal (Grand Bargain) where data is not available in the Data Store once it becomes unavailable in the Registry.</p>
<p>While some publishers remove their data on purpose, sometimes data becomes unreachable and therefore will be removed from the Datastore.</p>
<p>What retention policy should we take into consideration here and should the Registry have a publisher ‘kill-switch’ which could tell other services down the data pipeline (Datastore etc) to remove data if that is checked to True in case of a retention policy of say 30 days?</p>

            <p>Hello,<br>
I’ve done some research on this topic, but also wanted to gain community feedback. Has anyone worked with a system based in Salesforce to publish information to the IATI Standard, and if so, what were some of the takeaways, both positive and negative? Thanks.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, <a href="http://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-topics/crs-xml.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">these ‘CRS data in IATI format’ files</a> are not published on the registry - is that the case?</p>

          <title>Connecting an organization&#39;s Chart of Accounts to the IATI Standard</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[db2202000]]></dc:creator>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello,<br>
The organization I am working with is in the process of going through a merger, so we’re trying to set up a combined chart of accounts system. Our Finance team has some concerns about how to do that and be able to generate the necessary information for IATI standard publishing. As I read it as long as we can aggregate information on disbursements, expenditures, etc. by project effectively, we may not need to worry about creating long strings pegging the Chart of Accounts down to the OECD DAC 5 digit code level. I was wondering what others’ experiences have been with doing the financial side of IATI reporting as it pertains to generating reports through your organizations’ accounting systems. Thanks.</p>

          <title>Data divergence between registry and datastore</title>

            <p>Thanks very much <a class="mention" href="/u/katehughes">@KateHughes</a> for the <a href="https://iatistandard.org/en/news/iati-technical-team-our-detailed-quarterly-update/" rel="nofollow noopener">quarterly update</a>  perhaps worth posting on the forums too?</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/iati-techteam">@IATI-techteam</a> In it I learnt that the new datastore will access data from the validator API, not directly from the registry. This suggests that the registry and the datastore could end up with different data i.e. a query via the registry to see how many active activities are there in country X could be different from the same query via the new datastore? Is this correct or have I missed something? If so, is one of them (registry API, validator API, datastore API) going to be ‘official’?</p>

          <title>Mapping Sectors/Sector Categories to SDGs</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[sobiero]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Welcome to IATI Discuss</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I’m trying to use IATI data to show how activities are implemented towards achieving the SDGs in Kenya. However, I have realized that a number of activities have not captured SDGs information though they have sectors and/or sector category information. Is there a mapping of Sectors/Sector Categories to SDGs or any other field that I can use to link activities to SDG(s) ?</p>

          <title>Sector Vocabularies - from ISIC to OECD DAC-5</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[apnishio]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Welcome to IATI Discuss</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Dear all, as you know IATI recommends OECD DAC-5 digit Purpose Codes. The UN has also adopted this vocabulary for the UN Data Cube.<br>
UNIDO, being a specialized agency focused on Industrialization, has historically used ISIC (<a href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/publication/seriesm/seriesm_4rev4e.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">https://unstats.un.org/unsd/publication/seriesm/seriesm_4rev4e.pdf</a>, Section/Division)  but that’s a specialized vocabulary (for industry).<br>
For the time being we adopted OECD DAC-3 and reported all our activities as ‘321’ (Industry). It minimally works but it’s too high level as within the Industry Theme we work with very different initiatives, and some may even be in other groups.<br>
We would like to transition to OECD DAC-5 but we need to map our existing classification. Is anybody aware of any “official/generally accepted” mapping of ISIC to OECD DAC-5 and vice-versa? Alternatively, could you indicate another suitable forum for this question? We asked our statistics department but they have no exposure to OECD DAC, they only work with ISIC and are not familiar with any mapping. Thank you! Ana Paula</p>

          <title>Discuss Forum Clean Up Proposal</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[JoshStanley]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Welcome to IATI Discuss</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi IATI Community,</p>
<p>As IATI’s new Business &amp; Data Analyst I am pleased to be adding my first post to the Discuss forum!</p>
<p>Discuss is the main tool for members of the community to converse and engage about all things IATI. As such we need to ensure that it is presented in a way that best encourages productive discussion.</p>
<p>There are a large number of old/dormant topics that are currently visible to users when they access the platform.</p>
<p>For example, almost three quarters of all topics (totalling 182 topics!) in the Community Zone category have not been replied to since Jan 2018.</p>
<p>Please see this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d46KbaJ1dWQzTIpj_p9WF0kZmXYotMV3zR94w74FR0g/edit?usp=sharing">spreadsheet </a>for more info (all stats correct as of 07/02/2019 PM). The ‘% Topics not updated since 01/01/2018’ in particular shows the volume of ‘old’ topics:</p>
<p>Because of this, when someone accesses Discuss, it can be difficult to understand where to start, and the especially important posts might slip out of sight.</p>
<p>Therefore, the IATI Technical Team propose a ‘clean-up’ of the platform, to ensure that only relevant and current conversations are immediately visible, without losing content or inadvertently closing down discussion.</p>
<p>Our proposal to achieve this consists of the following:</p>
<p><strong>1) ‘Close’ all topics which have not been updated in over 12 months.</strong> Closing a topic essentially means the following:</p>
<p>o A ‘lock’ icon is displayed next to the topic</p>
<p>o Users are no longer able to reply to the topic</p>
<p>o Users are no longer able to use the ‘invite’ function on the topic</p>
<p>The following functions are still available on a ‘closed’ topic:</p>
<p>o Users’ ability to read all posts</p>
<p>o Users’ ability to delete a post</p>
<p>o Users’ ability to ‘like’ a post</p>
<p>o Users’ ability to vote on a poll</p>
<p><strong>2) Create an ‘Archived’ sub-category within each existing category in Discuss. All closed topics will be moved to the appropriate Archive sub-category.</strong></p>
<p>This will allow users to easily access closed topics, while ensuring that they are still in an easily accessible place for when a user wishes to retrieve an archived discussion.</p>
<p><strong>Interacting with old topics</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Archived posts will still be available for retrieval via Discuss’ Search function</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you would like to restart discussion on an archived topic, a new topic should be created which contains a link to the archived topic in the original post.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As ever, we welcome the community’s input on the proposed clean-up: will the suggestions have any adverse reactions on your use of the platform? Do you have any further suggestions to improve how topics/categories are presented?</p>
<p>We expect to begin the clean-up exercise on Monday 18th Feb, so please offer any suggestions for the process by then.</p>
<p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>Josh</p>

          <title>Use of XI identifiers for national or sub-national NGOs and CSOs</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[SJohns]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Welcome to IATI Discuss</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I have been doing some investigation into the use of the XI identifiers for civil society organisations/networks. I’ll write it up properly, but I just wanted to open up some thoughts that I have had.</p>
<p>IATI organisation identifiers are unique to each organisation and their function is to tag an activity back to the organisation. But an IATI organisation ID is also another tool for data users to help them identify an organisation from the details in the ID, and thus to show the organisation is who they say they are. This is important because anecdoctally we are hearing that funders and international NGOs are using IATI data to find partner organisations.</p>
<p>The organisation identifier rules are <a href="http://reference.iatistandard.org/203/organisation-identifiers/" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a> but generally this has been handed over to <a href="http://org-id.guide/" rel="nofollow noopener">org-id.guide</a>, a service hosted by <a href="http://org-id.guide/about" rel="nofollow noopener">Open Data Services Cooperative</a> in the UK.</p>
<p>I’d like to flag up the growth in issuing XI-IATI- identifiers to national and sub-national level NGOs (NNGOs) and civil society organisations (CSOs). Funders are pushing for transparency of the delivery chain and at the same time increasing funding directly to NNGOs/CSOs, which means that there’s a new market in NNGOs and CSOs having an IATI ID. Whilst most NNGOs and CSOs in countries with stable registration systems will have an IATI ID, XI-IATI- are being issued where the org-id.guide team cannot find out how NNGOs/CSOs are registered/deemed legitimate in country contexts that do not have easily accessible/online registration systems.</p>
<p>My challenge is therefore: how can we serve NNGOs/CSOs in these contexts better and ensure that they own a unique ID that reflects their reality and also provides the useful information to data users?</p>
<p>This is an important challenge not just for IATI, but for all the other data standards that use the org-id.guide to generate unique IDs for organisations. I know that the org-id.guide is on the surface just a centralised list of registries, but there is a risk of excluding NNGOs and CSOs from being properly identified, if this challenge is not solved.</p>
<p>Reviewing the <a href="http://reference.iatistandard.org/203/codelists/IATIOrganisationIdentifier/" rel="nofollow noopener">list of XI-IATI identifiers</a> and looking at the org-id.guide issues list on Github, I worked on the premise that the majority of CSOs that need identifiers, will need them because they are receiving funding. Therefore they will have a bank account or their nearest family member will have a bank account. To have a bank account they will need to be a registered entity. This also holds true for international networks and alliances that are receiving funding. If an organisation does not meet this criteria, it’s perhaps enough to be named in the funder’s data and not have an IATI organisation identifier.</p>
<p>In the 30 minutes I had to do a review, I found two organisations which could legitimately have a unique ID.</p>
<p>The first is, I think, a legacy issue. The network <a href="https://www.iatiregistry.org/publisher/cabi" rel="nofollow noopener">CABI</a> has the identifier XI-IATI-CABI. However a search on the UK <a href="https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/01973924" rel="nofollow noopener">Companies House</a> shows that it has the registration number 1973924.</p>
<p>The second is a recent <a href="https://github.com/org-id/register/issues/317" rel="nofollow noopener">org-id.guide issue</a>  for Somalia Family Services. ODSC were unable to find a registry in Puntland, Somalia, that was suitable, so ODSC closed the issue and handed the request back to the IATI technical team to issue an XI-IATI identifier. However, a quick search shows that <a href="http://ussfs.org/sfs/who-we-are/" rel="nofollow noopener">Somalia Family Services</a> is a US registered organisation, and the Puntland organisation is a locally registered operational office:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The United States based Somali Family Services here after referred to as “SFS” is a non‐profit organization headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota registered under Federal Act 501(C3) and a leading Somali capacity enhancement entity, locally registered with the Ministry of Planning and Local Government in Garowe, Puntland</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the very least, Somalia Family Services could use the US-EIN number of the US office, which would show that the organisation is who they say they are. Even better, the US organisation should be able to provide advice on how their Puntland office is registered with the government which would help build up the list for Somalia.</p>
<p>I am still thinking through the solutions to this challenge. My feeling is that it includes the engagement of national NNGO and CSO networks to advise IATI and org-id.guide. At the very least by acting now, we can ensure that organisations take ownership of their own unique IDs rather than accepting the default of XI-IATI identifiers.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>

          <title>Open Data Services &amp; IATI validation project</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[stevieflow]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Welcome to IATI Discuss</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Dear colleagues</p>
<p>It’s great to see the enhanced validation services being commissioned by IATI.  Back in 2009, my then-colleague David Carpenter built the very first (and <a href="http://validator.iatistandard.org" rel="nofollow noopener">the one we all still use</a>!) validator quite quickly, mainly so that I could share test results with the emerging publishers (there was quite a rush around Busan!).  Over the subsequent years, as our community needs for better and more robust data has grown, the discussions around validation have been both rewarding and reinforcing - the new validation service should both cement and further our learning.</p>
<p>Indeed, as we established and grew <a href="http://opendataservices.coop/" rel="nofollow noopener">Open Data Services Co-operative</a>, the learning around data validation via IATI has been applied in other standards we’ve helped develop: <a href="http://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/" rel="nofollow noopener">Open Contracting Data Standard</a> (OCDS); <a href="http://standard.threesixtygiving.org/en/latest/" rel="nofollow noopener">360Giving</a> and <a href="https://standard.openownership.org/en/v0-1/" rel="nofollow noopener">Beneficial Ownership</a>.  To this end, we then invested in our <a href="http://iati.cove.opendataservices.coop/" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>CoVE platform to enable an IATI version</strong></a>. With this, we can now test IATI data against schema, ruleset and embedded codelists.  This has proven valuable as we’ve consulted for a number of organisations to publish and/or enhance their IATI data.</p>
<p>Therefore, at face value, the opportunity to tender for a centralised IATI validation service was of tremendous excitement.  At the same time, my appointment as IATI TAG Chair also gave us a certain degree of hesitation - particularly from a conflict of interest point of view.  Whilst it could be possible to recuse myself and compartmentalise responsibility, it’s also difficult to imagine the Chair of the TAG community holding any work to account, whilst also having an interest in the vendor delivering it.  It is for this reason that my colleagues and I at Open Data Services Co-operative <strong>decided to not bid for this work</strong>, either alone or with partners.</p>
<p>We welcome the eventual provider, and wish to provide all our support (and <a href="https://github.com/OpenDataServices/cove/" rel="nofollow noopener">our open code</a>, of course) to ensure the resultant service is of high quality and reliability.  To this end, colleagues such as <a class="mention" href="/u/rory_scott">@rory_scott</a> and <a class="mention" href="/u/robredpath">@robredpath</a> will share here further insights and learnings around data validation, which we hope will be of interest to the community and service provider.</p>
<p>For myself as TAG Chair, I am grateful that I can also focus on these issues, safe that this conflict of interest is not a factor. There’s a tinge of sadness in the we cannot be involved in the delivery  - as we genuinely <em>love</em> IATI validation.  However, we also think our step back from this opportunity will be a benefit to our collaborative aims: that <strong>high-quality data on development and humanitarian activities will be useful, usable and in widespread use</strong>.</p>

            <p>Dear all,</p>
<p>On behalf of Caritas Denmark, we, as EyeOpenerWorks, are currently conducting a research on IATI activities in Uganda (It’s the research that was mentioned in a topic by Maj Forum below).</p>
<p>Part of the research consists of mappig all the current activities on capacity-building of local organizations regarding IATI in Uganda. The research itself serves the purpose of (possibly) designing a capacity-building facility for local CSOs on how to publish and navigate IATI data.</p>
<p>As such, we would hereby like to find out if there are IATI activities taking place that are not yet on our radar! So i would warmly like to invite everybody who knows of such activities.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

          <title>How do you structure your projects?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[JohnAdams]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Welcome to IATI Discuss</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>We are carrying out some work to refine and improve the way we structure programmes and projects within DFID.</p>
<p>At present we have a “simple” two-tier structure (called Project and Component). The Project level contains the overall purpose and narrative for the activity - including business case, reviews and logframe. The Component level contains one or more agreements (purchase orders, grants, MOUs) with details of geography, sector, funding arrangement, transactions etc.</p>
<p>This works for some simple programmes, but breaks down where there are more complex arrangements such as umbrella programmes, where there can be hundreds of Components under one Project. The 2-tier model doesn’t match the reality of our range of programming.</p>
<p>We would like to move to a structure that better reflects this reality and diversity of programming, that helps programme managers to describe their programmes well, and that captures the important data at the right level.</p>
<p>What do other donors do? Do you have a multi-level structure or do you have a single tier activity level? How do you map your structure to IATI?</p>
<p>Please either share here or email me directly with your diagrams!</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>John</p>
