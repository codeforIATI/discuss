          <title>COVID-19 prototype visualisation updates</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[markbrough]]></dc:creator>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I hope everyone is doing OK during these difficult times!</p>
<p>On behalf of the <a href="https://interagencystandingcommittee.org/greater-transparency" rel="nofollow noopener">Grand Bargain transparency workstream</a>, we have made some further improvements to <a href="https://covid19.humportal.org/activities/" rel="nofollow noopener">the COVID-19 prototype visualisation</a> (see <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/new-covid-19-funding-data-visualisation-launched/1969">original post here</a>) and wanted to share these with the IATI community.</p>
<p>The number of COVID-19 activities has now significantly increased to over 5000 – the visualisation now automatically updates every hour.</p>
<p>We’ve recently added the following additional functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>summarise by commitments or disbursements</li>
<li>breakdown by reporting organisation, country or sector</li>
<li>filter by sector</li>
<li>download transactions in Excel, expanded out by country and sector (e.g. where a single transaction relates to multiple countries or sectors) - allowing for detailed analysis</li>
<li>share / save the current view based on selected filters (the URL is now updated)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>(NB most of the improvements refer to the <strong>activities</strong> tab, which uses IATI data)</em></p>
<p>I wanted to talk through some of this work and ask for feedback from the IATI community regarding whether this is a good way of reprocessing and presenting the data.</p>

<h2>Summarising by commitments / disbursements</h2>

<em><a href="https://covid19.humportal.org/activities/?country=LR&amp;summary=commitments" rel="nofollow noopener">Total commitments for activities in Liberia, by reporting organisation</a></em></p>
<p>Initially, we just showed a list of projects, with a summary at the top showing the <a href="https://covid19.humportal.org/activities" rel="nofollow noopener">number of activities</a> for each reporting organisation or country. We added new functionality to roll up by <a href="https://covid19.humportal.org/activities?summary=commitments" rel="nofollow noopener">commitments</a> or <a href="https://covid19.humportal.org/activities?summary=disbursements" rel="nofollow noopener">disbursements</a>. In order to do this, we had to undertake some reprocessing of the data:</p>
<ul>
<li>all values are converted to USD according to the <code>value-date</code>, <a href="https://exchangerates.codeforiati.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">using this dataset</a> (with rates sourced from the OECD and Federal Reserve)</li>
<li>where there are multiple sectors or countries on an activity, transactions are broken down into multiple rows for each sector/country, with the transaction value proportionate to the sector/country percentages.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/markbrough/covid19-data/blob/gh-pages/xlsx/traceability/transactions_sectors_countries_regions.xlsx?raw=true" rel="nofollow noopener">resulting data is available in Excel here</a>, in case you want to take a look.</p>
<h3>Double-counting</h3>
<p><img src="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/original/1X/ccd933136de6a6abf4afea29a1258ca270ca9a6f.png" alt="image|660x5075" data-base62-sha1="teaKBRQlAZo0MsgB9kNuBRZCyaX" width="660" height="50"><br>
<em>Warning if results are likely to contain double-counting</em></p>
<p>We don’t currently handle double-counting in this dataset or visualisation, other than to alert the user when there is a risk of double-counting. However, there are a few ideas about how this could be handled:</p>
<ul>
<li>allow / encourage users to select to view only a particular type of organisation
<ul>
<li>e.g. there is less likely to be double-counting when looking only at Governments, though there will still be some double-counting in cases of delegated cooperation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>show net disbursements instead of disbursements and net commitments instead of commitments
<ul>
<li>i.e. disbursements MINUS incoming funds and commitments MINUS incoming commitments</li>
<li>however, this will only work where organisations are reporting incoming funds; many large organisations are not doing so.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>comparing organisation IDs or (harder!) organisation names – e.g. if Germany is disbursing to UNDP, we could try to subtract that amount from UNDP’s total
<ul>
<li>this could get a bit messy!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We would be very keen to hear if anyone has suggestions on the best way to proceed here!</p>

<h2>Sectors</h2>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/original/1X/da2cd1d843969888983e28afe6774fa018b3c291.png" data-download-href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/da2cd1d843969888983e28afe6774fa018b3c291" title="image"><img src="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/da2cd1d843969888983e28afe6774fa018b3c291_2_517x239.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="v8475vlW4F54A6zcHtnXlEecM6t" width="517" height="239" srcset="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/da2cd1d843969888983e28afe6774fa018b3c291_2_517x239.png, https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/da2cd1d843969888983e28afe6774fa018b3c291_2_775x358.png 1.5x, https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/da2cd1d843969888983e28afe6774fa018b3c291_2_1034x478.png 2x" data-small-upload="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/da2cd1d843969888983e28afe6774fa018b3c291_2_10x10.png"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">image</span><span class="informations">1105×512 57.2 KB</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div><br>
<em><a href="https://covid19.humportal.org/activities/?summary=commitments&amp;breakdown=sector" rel="nofollow noopener">Total commitments by sector</a></em></p>
<p>It’s also now possible to summarise the data by sectors (we are only using the DAC codes here). Again, as shown in the image above, this summary may currently lead to double counting where more than one reporting organisation is included.</p>
<p>Perhaps it would be useful to be able to summarise by multiple sectors, and to select whole categories at once (e.g. all health or education sectors) – any other preferences?</p>
<hr>
<h2>Downloads</h2>
<p>We have added a series of additional download options. On the activities tab, the blue download button now allow you to download <a href="https://github.com/markbrough/covid19-data/blob/gh-pages/traceability/transactions_sectors_countries_regions.xlsx?raw=true" rel="nofollow noopener">transactions broken down by sector and country/region</a>. For this dataset, an additional column has been added (<code>value_USD_proportionate</code>) which makes it easy to put a pivot table on top of the dataset. This column is calculated by multiplying the <code>value_USD</code> column by the proportion allocated to this sector and this country/region.</p>
<p>For example: a transaction for USD 100, allocated 40% health and 60% education; 50% to Kenya and 50% to Uganda would be output as:</p>
<div class="md-table">
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>value_USD</th>
<th>sector</th>
<th>country_region</th>
<th>value_USD_proportionate</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>health</td>
<td>Kenya</td>
<td>20</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>health</td>
<td>Uganda</td>
<td>20</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>education</td>
<td>Kenya</td>
<td>30</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>education</td>
<td>Uganda</td>
<td>30</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div><p>In the dataset, the <code>sector</code> and <code>country_region</code> are output with the relevant sector or country codes, rather than the full sector/country names, in order to reduce the filesize.</p>

<h2>Other plans and feedback</h2>
<p>We are working on a few more improvements to the visualisation at the moment, for example to include the ability to filter by grant or loan. We’d be very keen to hear from anyone who might have further suggestions on how we could best present this data.</p>
<p>You are very welcome to add feedback here, or alternatively email us at: <a href="mailto:humportal@devinit.org">humportal@devinit.org</a></p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>On behalf of the Grand Bargain transparency workstream, Development Initiatives has just launched a new prototype visualisation of funding to the Covid-19 global development response, using FTS and IATI data.</p>
<p>The prototype aims to encourage the use of data on Covid-19 financing by demonstrating how it can be made more accessible and showcasing its potential. It has been developed with leading donors and aid organisations who have committed to <a href="https://interagencystandingcommittee.org/greater-transparency" rel="nofollow noopener">greater transparency through the Grand Bargain</a> and reacted quickly to demands for increased transparency around humanitarian and development finance during the pandemic.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://devinit.org/blog/strengthening-data-driven-transparency-response-covid-19/" rel="nofollow noopener">read the blog here</a> and explore the visualisation yourself via the following link:<br>

<h4><strong>Analysis of COVID-19 data</strong></h4>
<p>The Secretariat is currently undertaking analysis of COVID-19 data published so far. The analysis will help provide a better understanding on which organisations are publishing, how they are publishing, what this data tells about COVID-19-related activities, and if/how this data meets user needs.</p>
<p>Based on this analysis, the Secretariat will engage specific organisations with the goal of improving the volume and quality of COVID-19 data published. We encourage organisation that have not yet published data, to use the <a href="https://iatistandard.org/en/news/publishing-data-covid-19-using-iati-standard/">IATI publishing guidance</a> to do so as soon as possible., This will enable the Secretariat to include as many datasets as possible in the analysis, provide assistance to address specific issues arising and identify and discuss systemic issues with the broader community.</p>
<p>This webinar will be an opportunity to share these findings with the community and to continue discussions on if/how further adjustments are needed to publishing to ensure that this data meets the needs of IATI data users. We will also share guiding questions to registered participants in advance of the webinar.</p>

          <title>COVID-19 data access and use guidance launched</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[IATI-techteam]]></dc:creator>
          <category>COVID-19</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>New guidance has been released on how to access and use IATI data on COVID-19. The guidance explains how to find data on activities published by organisations on their response to the global pandemic. To date, over <a href="http://d-portal.org/ctrack.html?aids=COVID-19#view=main">500 COVID-19-related projects</a> have been published by a wide range of organisations, for example, donor governments, UN agencies and NGOs.</p>
<h3>View <a href="https://bit.ly/2SR32J1"> <em>Guidance: Accessing and Using COVID-19 Data</em> </a>
</h3>
<p>In the guidance, data users can find instructions on how to search for COVID-19-related activities using IATI’s online tools, including d-portal and the Datastore Query Builder and API. This guidance follows the publication of guidance for organisations on how to <a href="https://iatistandard.org/en/news/updated-covid-19-guidance-iati-publishers/"> <em>publish</em>  data on the COVID-19 pandemic.</a></p>
<p>By accessing IATI data, users can supplement their information on international resources responding to COVID-19. Good data is critical to avoid duplication, improve coordination and enable recipient governments to know what resources are flowing into their countries.</p>
<h4><strong>Updating guidance</strong></h4>

          <title>Using the org file to report Covid-19 budget?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Melinda]]></dc:creator>
          <category>COVID-19</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Has anyone considered using the org-file to report how much of one’s budget is allocatied/redirected to Covid-19? The reason I ask is that some organizations can say of their budget is expected to go to Covid-19 but are unable to specify activity data. This information is shared between providers but is shared in a manual and unstructured manner. I was speaking to <a class="mention" href="/u/avaughn">@AVaughn</a> about this last week and it seems unreasonable that organizations call eachother to gather this information on spreadsheets. I mean, this is tedious work and the information could quickly become out of date.</p>
<p>I came to think of suggestions <span class="mention">@OJ</span>_ proposed a couple of years ago (but then suggesting that core support coming in to an organization could be presented in org file (I hope I remember that correctly)).</p>
<p>With other words, make the org file more of a narrative of an organizations overall budget instead of focusing on the forward looking aggregated budget. Last summer <a class="mention" href="/u/stevieflow">@stevieflow</a> brought up the question if the org file is used (under topic: Does anyone use the Organisation file?). Maybe we could think wider about the use cases.</p>
<p>However, the org file specifies where the money is going (org or country) but doesn’t specify the purpose as far as I can see. So this may not at all be reasonable. In that case it should be possible to publish a document with the overall Covid-19 spending. Unless anybody sees a reason for not doing so.</p>

          <title>Current Discussion: Diverted / repurposed funding due to COVID-19</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[IATI-techteam]]></dc:creator>
          <category>COVID-19</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>A number of funds and activities are being turned fully or partially into COVID-19 activities. How should these changes be reflected in IATI data? How should activities and transactions be identified? Activities could be split into COVID-19 and non COVID-19 components.</p>
<p>This could look like:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cancelling existing activities and creating two new ones. Helps to easily identify COVID-19 activities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Showing a removal of funds from existing activities and setting up a new COVID-19 one</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keeping the one activity but adding new classifications to show the percentage split between COVID-19 and non COVID-19</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Options depend on how an organisation’s business models and internal systems work. But to track the redirection in funding options include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Adding ‘redirected’ into activity titles and descriptions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using the sector element to show percentage splits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using outgoing and incoming funds, with a COVID-19 description to show the redirection of funds.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For previous discussions, please see the following posts from <a class="mention" href="/u/melinda">@Melinda</a> <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/proposing-another-formal-method-of-classifying-covid-19-activities/1921/26">here</a> and <a class="mention" href="/u/anna.pe">@Anna.Pe</a>  <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/proposing-another-formal-method-of-classifying-covid-19-activities/1921/23">here</a>.</p>

          <title>Current Discussion: Quantifying percentage of funds allocated from an activity to COVID-19</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[IATI-techteam]]></dc:creator>
          <category>COVID-19</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>One question about COVID-19 IATI data, is how can we tell exactly how much of a given activity is being budgeted, committed and spent on COVID19. This is particularly relevant where activities may be a mix, or contain some redirected funds.</p>
<p>Two options have been proposed:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Add in COVID-19 to transaction narratives. This allows publishers to detail which commitments, incoming funds and disbursements are specific COVID-19 funding. Most organisations can already do this. However, this is cumbersome to find for data users, not all transactions may be COVID-19 specific, and timeliness of data is an issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Or the sector element could be used. A binary ‘COVID-19’ and ‘not COVID-19’ category could be used. Either from adding a new codelist or organisations using vocabulary 98 and 99. This can be published alongside other sector elements and provide data users a way of interpreting budget allocations and other financial details. However, this option must also include the narrative element, how would this be used? If reported at transaction level, transactions will need to be separated into COVID-19 and not COVID-19.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please see <a class="mention" href="/u/rory_scott">@rory_scott</a>  's <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/proposing-another-formal-method-of-classifying-covid-19-activities/1921">post</a> and <a class="mention" href="/u/jieruz">@JieruZ</a> 's <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/proposing-another-formal-method-of-classifying-covid-19-activities/1921/25">post</a> on using the Sector element for previous discussions.</p>

          <title>Using IATI for COVID in Palestine</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[matmaxgeds]]></dc:creator>
          <category>COVID-19</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi, I was going to keep a log of how we were using IATI data for COVID in Palestine as a feed into the guidance on COVID for data users discussed on the webinar.</p>
<p>So far (10th April)  d-portal shows us <a href="http://www.d-portal.org/ctrack.html?text_search=covid&amp;country_code=PS#view=main" rel="nofollow noopener">5 activities</a> with thanks to Oxfam and DFID for being so fast - that is the first lesson, coordination decisions about what to fund are being taken on a weekly basis so for COVID, if IATI data is going to be any use, we need weekly (if not daily publishing).</p>
<p>The second feedback is that we currently have to do multiple searches e.g.:</p>
<ol>
<li>On <a href="http://www.d-portal.org/ctrack.html?text_search=covid&amp;country_code=PS#view=active" rel="nofollow noopener">d-portal for "COVID</a>" (which also captures COVID-19)</li>
<li>on d-portal for 'Coronavirus" (none yet but seen in other countries, and globlaly) and then</li>
<li>A techie (is this available via the interface?) version of <a href="https://d-portal.org/ctrack.html?/humanitarian-scope@code=EP-2020-000012-001&amp;country_code=PS#view=active" rel="nofollow noopener">d-portal for the GLIDE code</a>:</li>
<li>An <a href="https://iati.cloud/search/activity?q=recipient_country_code:(PS)%20AND%20(title_narrative:%22COVID%22%20OR%20description_narrative:%22COVID%22%20OR%20humanitarian_scope_code:%22EP-2020-000012-001%22%20OR%20humanitarian_scope_code:%22HCOVD20%22%20OR%20tag_code:%22EP-2020-000012-001%22)&amp;wt=json&amp;rows=500000" rel="nofollow noopener">even more comprehensive search on the new datastore</a> but that I don’t think can be done via the user interface - and weirdly the datastore only has 2 projects where d-portal has 5?</li>
</ol>
<p>Once all those searches have been done, we have to combine all the different results, remove all the duplication/double counting, and then add it to all the data from non-IATI publishers.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>A <a href="https://fts.unocha.org/data-search/results/incoming?usageYears=2020&amp;locations=171&amp;f%5B0%5D=destinationEmergencyIdName%3A%22911%3ACoronavirus%20disease%20Outbreak%20-%20COVID%20-19%22" rel="nofollow noopener">search on the FTS database.</a>…which has many activities which are not in d-portal</li>
<li>An excel based tracking sheet sent out to country offices of partners</li>
</ol>
<p>As of 10th April, D-portal has 5 activities when searching for COVID, 4 activities when searching by GLIDE code, the new Datastore has 2 activities, the FTS has 46 activities (many are global) and our in-country dataset has well over 100 projects - from both IATI and non-IATI publishers.</p>
<p>So far we have found:<br>
A) IATI is helpful for us to find actors who are delivering outside of the formal plans/working groups<br>
B) IATI is not rapid enough (except for Oxfam), and not consistent across the different IATI portals, or e.g. compared to the FTS (I really wish they would restart publishing FTS data in IATI format)<br>
C) On a single activity basis IATI can tell us how much money is flowing, but not across multiple publishers - due to the difficulty in working out which activities are the same project just from different publishers<br>
D) No activity titles are in Arabic etc - so we have to translate them for our colleagues in all the Ministries.<br>
E) We see how using different options helps publishers - but unless there is a way to search all the different options in one search query (and through the interface non-techies can access) then <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/covid-19-iati-publishing-guidance-consultation-6-20-april/1925/2">the different ways of reporting make a huge mess</a> for us and make it probably not worth the effort.</p>
<p>I will try to keep this up to date as the situation progresses - hopefully with just a few tweaks this can be improved substantially.</p>

            <p>Many thanks to everyone who’s contributed views on IATI’s <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=11XTnrPw8K76JvBhFfnqo-1Z9BmgqzWv2bEz9QoDrw2k">COVID-19 publishing guidance</a>. In response to your views <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/covid-19-guidance-musings/1918">here</a> and <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/proposing-another-formal-method-of-classifying-covid-19-activities/1921">here</a>, this post will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Explain the rationale for the content of the existing guidance</li>
<li>Provide information on a two-week consultation with the IATI community</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Rationale for content on COVID-19 IATI Standard guidance</strong></p>
<p>We created the existing IATI COVID-19 guidance to rapidly respond to daily increases in the number of organisations publishing COVID-19 related activities using the Standard. The content aimed to <strong>a)</strong> be quick and simple to implement <strong>b)</strong> align with other major humanitarian partners reporting <strong>c)</strong> allow users quick and easy access of the data with IATI tools.</p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Humanitarian Scope</strong> - we included this element in discussion with UN OCHA FTS, HDX and WHO. By aligning IATI data to other partners’ reporting, we are promoting interoperability of IATI data within the humanitarian sector and we will continue to advise organisations to follow this guidance. Additionally, we recommended that humanitarian activities responding to COVID-19 also use the humanitarian attribute at activity and/or transaction level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Title -</strong> including COVID-19 in the Activity title is simple and easy to implement, and can be found using free-text searches on d-portal and the Datastore. We will continue to advise organisations to include COVID-19 in their title, however if publishers are unable to do so, they should include this in their Activity description.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consultation: Publication and use of COVID-19 data (6-20 April)</strong></p>
<p>We understand that other members of the IATI community have suggestions on updating the COVID-19 publishing guidance, particularly on data on development activities.</p>
<p>Therefore we will launch a two-week consultation on Monday to gather your views on publishing and using data on COVID-19. We will incorporate feedback and suggestions already posted on Discuss about this issue and would really welcome additional views for the consultation on IATI Discuss, as well as through email and on the upcoming <a href="https://zoom.us/meeting/register/uZMtduGsqzIrpeco55RgsKn5TE-2BwoUbQ">IATI webinar on 7 April</a>.</p>
<p>After the consultation, we will propose updates on the guidance and summarise how users can access the data published on IATI tools.</p>
<p><strong>COVID-19 Webinar 7 April</strong></p>
<p>We invite you to discuss your views on the upcoming <a href="https://zoom.us/meeting/register/uZMtduGsqzIrpeco55RgsKn5TE-2BwoUbQ">COVID-19 webinar- Tuesday 7 April, 3:30pm UK time</a>. IATI’s Technical Team will firstly take participants through how to use the existing guidance and then hold a technical discussion on updating the guidance in the second part of the webinar. Register here and send any questions or comments to the IATI Technical Team in advance: <a href="mailto:support@iatistandard.org">support@iatistandard.org</a>.</p>
<p>We continue to wish all members of the IATI community well and hope your organisations are managing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as best you can.</p>
<p>Do keep in touch though IATI Discuss or by emailing <a href="mailto:support@iatistandard.org">support@iatistandard.org</a></p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>
<p>IATI Technical Team</p>

          <title>Proposing another formal method of classifying COVID-19 activities</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[rory_scott]]></dc:creator>
          <category>COVID-19</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Many thanks to everyone for the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11XTnrPw8K76JvBhFfnqo-1Z9BmgqzWv2bEz9QoDrw2k/edit" rel="nofollow noopener">rapid thinking COVID-19</a>.</p>
<p>I have two issues which have led me to consider three further options for classification.</p>
<h2>Issues</h2>
<h3>Classifying Using Text</h3>
<p>I don’t think this should be a formal method of classifying relevant activities - at least not on its own.</p>
<p>Although I absolutely encourage all publishers to be descriptive with project titles, there are legitimate reasons not to include “COVID-19”. There could be an existing convention of naming activities based on the country office they’re based in; it could be that the project has been named based on contractual or partnership details; it could be that the work is looking at <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/naming-the-coronavirus-disease-(covid-2019)-and-the-virus-that-causes-it" rel="nofollow noopener">the virus, not the disease</a>.</p>
<p>To be clear, I think that using this approach will absolutely be helpful, but that it is not sufficient on its own.</p>
<h3>Lack of Non-Humanitarian Classifications</h3>
<p>In the linked guidance, it’s acknowledged that not all COVID-19 related projects will be humanitarian. Indeed, DFID is likely to have a mixture of hum / non-hum responses, as the pandemic touches all aspects of our work.</p>
<p>However, I presume it’s not best practice to use <code>&lt;humanitarian-scope&gt;</code> in a non-humanitarian activity. Although I can’t find any formal rule saying as much, intuitively I would only look for this element in activities where <code>@humanitarian</code> is true.</p>
<p>To allow for robust (non-statistical - see below) classification, I think one of the following three options needs to be endorsed by us as a community, and by the secretariat as a steward. I’ve very possibly missed something here, so shout if so.</p>
<h2>Options</h2>
<p>Personally I recommend either <strong>Option 1</strong> or <strong>Option 2</strong>, given my reluctance to use a <code>&lt;humanitarian-scope&gt;</code> element in non-humanitarian activities.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Option 1</h3>
<p><em><strong>Include GLIDE Codes as entries on the TagVocabulary codelist and recognise the following use of the <code>&lt;tag&gt;</code> element using it</strong></em></p>
<p>This would allow for any activity that is relevant to be tagged in the following way:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-xml">&lt;tag  vocabulary="1-2" code="EP-2020-000012-001" vocabulary-uri="https://glidenumber.net/glide/public/search/search.jsp"&gt; 
</code></pre>
<p>This assumes that the entry would have the same vocabulary <code>@code</code> as it does on the <a href="http://reference.iatistandard.org/203/codelists/HumanitarianScopeVocabulary/" rel="nofollow noopener">HumanitarianScopeVocabulary</a> codelist)</p>
<p><img src="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/images/emoji/twitter/+1.png?v=9" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"> Unambiguous<br>
<img src="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/images/emoji/twitter/+1.png?v=9" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"> Official<br>
<img src="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/images/emoji/twitter/-1.png?v=9" title=":-1:" class="emoji" alt=":-1:"> Requires (small) edit to the standard, which might take a bit of time<br>
<img src="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/images/emoji/twitter/-1.png?v=9" title=":-1:" class="emoji" alt=":-1:"> Not strictly necessary, given <strong>Option 2</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3>Option 2</h3>
<p><em><strong>Recognise the following use of the <code>&lt;tag&gt;</code> element, declaring GLIDE as a custom vocabulary using code 99, 98, 97, etc.</strong></em></p>
<pre><code class="lang-xml">&lt;tag  vocabulary="99" code="EP-2020-000012-001" vocabulary-uri="https://glidenumber.net/glide/public/search/search.jsp"&gt; 
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/images/emoji/twitter/+1.png?v=9" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"> Unambiguous<br>
<img src="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/images/emoji/twitter/+1.png?v=9" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"> Require no change to the standard<br>
<img src="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/images/emoji/twitter/+1.png?v=9" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"> Extensible approach - this can be done with any codelist with a unique URI<br>
<img src="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/images/emoji/twitter/-1.png?v=9" title=":-1:" class="emoji" alt=":-1:"> Depends on the vocabulary URI not changing, or being redirected if it does<br>
<img src="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/images/emoji/twitter/-1.png?v=9" title=":-1:" class="emoji" alt=":-1:"> More susceptible to typos!</p>
<hr>
<h3>Option 3</h3>
<p>Endorse the use of <code>&lt;humanitarian-scope&gt;</code> elements in activities which do not have <code>@humanitian='1'</code></p>
<p><img src="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/images/emoji/twitter/+1.png?v=9" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"> Require no change to the standard<br>
<img src="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/images/emoji/twitter/-1.png?v=9" title=":-1:" class="emoji" alt=":-1:"> Ambiguous<br>
<img src="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/images/emoji/twitter/-1.png?v=9" title=":-1:" class="emoji" alt=":-1:"> Possibly confusing<br>
<img src="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/images/emoji/twitter/-1.png?v=9" title=":-1:" class="emoji" alt=":-1:"> More susceptible to typos!<br>
<img src="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/images/emoji/twitter/-1.png?v=9" title=":-1:" class="emoji" alt=":-1:"> I’d argue that the humanitarian scope, tag, and sector should  have been <code>&lt;classification&gt;</code> elements all along <img src="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<hr>
<h2>What about quantification?</h2>
<p>In theory, it could be that people know exactly how much of a given activity is being budgeted, committed and spent on COVID 19. If so, we could use the approach of <strong>Option 2</strong> above to refer to it in the  element, as long as we could agree a ‘null’ value to pad the sector and ensure that it sums to 100 for that vocabulary. I’m planning to trial <a href="https://devtracker.dfid.gov.uk/custom-codes#policy-priorities" rel="nofollow noopener">a similar approach</a> with cross-government spending through International Climate Finance, and I’m interested to hear people’s thoughts.</p>

            <p>Perhaps I should just wait for the webinar in 10 minutes, but I was just corresponding with <a class="mention" href="/u/petyakangalova">@petyakangalova</a> on the support desk re. the Covid-19 guidance.</p>
<p>Essentially, there’s obvious scalability and useability concerns with adding free text “Covid-19” to the title. It gets the discoverability job done, but potentially becomes noise in activity titles as more and more programming has to adapt to a changing world. If coronavirus becomes a seasonal but unvaccinated ongoing reality, will every activity in the world eventually be suffixed as “–Covid-19”?</p>
<p>I had some brief discussions about using <code>&lt;tag&gt;</code> for Covid-19, but obviously that requires a new codelist to be added/used, and the obvious codelists are already in use in <code>&lt;humanitarian-scope&gt;</code></p>
<p>But that got me thinking: what exactly <em>is</em> Covid-19?</p>
<p>Sure, in  it’s an emergency/appeal, and for a certain audience that’s sufficient. But for a more generalist (or even niche) data user/researcher, <code>&lt;tag&gt;</code> was meant to be the user-desired yet easy-on-publishers discoverability tool. Of course, that requires codelists to avoid the perils of free text.</p>
<p>So aside from disaster/response codelists already spoken for, what <em>is</em> Covid-19 that makes it interesting to said researcher: a cross-cutting issue? a particular methodology (i.e. remote monitoring, local decision-making, socially distanced programming)? an international topic of concern? (To be clear, these are all poor examples that don’t translate well to codelists).</p>
<p>I guess my question is: <strong>has anyone else considered alternatives for tracking and tagging Covid-19 data within their donor ecosystem?</strong> (I know you have, but I’ll refrain from calling you out:-)</p>
