            <p><strong>Webinar: Using near real-time IATI data to track aid flows during the Covid-19 crisis</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date: 30th November 2020</strong></p>
<p><strong>Time: 12 noon-1pm GMT</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hosted by: Development Initiatives</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJYoc-mvrTwtE9I36cFB2b2sa_v9WsLGpgbc"><strong>Register here</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Moderator: Carolyn Culey, Director of Engagement and Partnerships</strong></p>
<p><strong>Speakers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Global analysis – Amy Dodd, Head of Engagement</strong></li>
<li><strong>East Africa analysis – Martha Bekele, Senior Analyst</strong></li>
<li><strong>Methodology – Bill Anderson, Information Architect</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>During the current Covid-19 crisis, having data on aid spending in as near to real-time as possible, has never been more important in understanding current trends and informing decisions. Detailed information on ODA spending in 2020 will not be published by the OECD DAC until the end of 2021. DI’s analysis uses near real-time IATI data to show <a href="https://devinit.org/resources/how-aid-changing-covid-19-pandemic/">how aid is changing during the Covid-19 pandemic</a>, and examines the implications of this. While our initial report focusses on global trends, a forthcoming report by our analysts’ team in East Africa looks at country-level data in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, and Rwanda.</p>
<p><strong>DI will present key findings from both reports, followed by a Q&amp;A session on these.</strong></p>
<p>Using IATI data in this way has presented both opportunities and challenges. In the second part of this webinar, DI will explain the methodology behind our analysis and highlight some of the issues we have encountered in using real-time IATI data. These are being logged and shared with IATI’s business analysts, to provide a feedback loop to publishers so they can further improve the quality of their data, to make it more usable for analysts.</p>
<p><strong>There will be a further round of Q&amp;A on methodology and on data challenges.</strong></p>

            <p>HI everyone</p>
<p>Thanks to d-portal, I noticed that there are 25,742 activities that have an SDG target or goal at the <code>tag</code> element</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/original/1X/ccb93482e72ac348979596122184d95e97aa42f8.jpeg" data-download-href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/ccb93482e72ac348979596122184d95e97aa42f8" title="d-portal"><img src="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/ccb93482e72ac348979596122184d95e97aa42f8_2_690x373.jpeg" alt="d-portal" data-base62-sha1="td4cECE5yZXNZDumYJcyjGVR5qM" width="690" height="373" srcset="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/ccb93482e72ac348979596122184d95e97aa42f8_2_690x373.jpeg, https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/ccb93482e72ac348979596122184d95e97aa42f8_2_1035x559.jpeg 1.5x, https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/ccb93482e72ac348979596122184d95e97aa42f8_2_1380x746.jpeg 2x" data-small-upload="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/ccb93482e72ac348979596122184d95e97aa42f8_2_10x10.png"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">d-portal</span><span class="informations">1982×1074 329 KB</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>
<p>d-portal also shows me that these activities are provided by 14 IATI publishers:</p>

<p>So - it’s good to see some usage.</p>
<p>However, does this match the user needs that drove the initial need to <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/update-from-the-sdg-working-group-draft-guidance-available-for-review/1783">produce focused guidance</a> on SDGs?</p>
<p>The number of publishers seem particularly low, vis-a-vis those that engaged in that whole process.</p>
<p>Should we expect more?  Has anyone attempted to use this data?  What can it tell us?</p>
<p>Look forward to any thoughts or insights!</p>

          <title>Best Practices - Aid Type and Grand Bargain</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Michelle_IOM]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Using IATI Data</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>Hoping to crowd source some ideas on best practices.  Apologies if this has been discussed before but I didn’t see it in previous discussions but admittedly I’m crap at finding old threads.  If I missed it don’t hesitate to point me to it.</p>
<p>There are AidType vocabulary for both OECD and Grand Bargain (GB) and from what I can tell  you can code the same activity (default level) or transaction (transaction level) against both.</p>
<p>Assuming that a publisher is:</p>
<ol>
<li>receiving money from a donor</li>
<li>is not passing it on to an implementing partner</li>
<li>coding at the transaction not activity level</li>
</ol>
<p>Questions, is it correct to assume:</p>
<ol>
<li>that codes 1-3 would only be used for incoming commitment (transaction type 11) or incoming funds (transaction type 1)</li>
<li>code 4 would be for expenditures?</li>
<li>is it best practice to code both transaction types 1 and 11 with aid types 1-3 or would it only be for the incoming commitment?</li>
</ol>
<p>Rather than replicating AidTypes in two different transaction types, it could simply be coded at the activity level.  But if these 3 vocabularies are only related to two transaction types won’t that mess up assumptions on the disbursement (3) and Expenditure (4) transaction types?</p>
<p>In looking at the list of GB signatories, only a handful actually code to the GB aid type vocabulary 2-4 so perhaps <a class="mention" href="/u/stolk">@stolk</a>, <a class="mention" href="/u/pelleaardema">@pelleaardema</a>, <a class="mention" href="/u/stevieflow">@stevieflow</a> can chime in here as they work for/with a few of them.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.<br>
Michelle</p>

            <p>I noticed that the Open Contracting Partnership (cc <a class="mention" href="/u/james_mckinney">@James_McKinney</a>) have published a <a href="https://www.open-contracting.org/what-is-open-contracting/covid19/" rel="nofollow noopener">guidance page and request for proposals</a> relating to $3,000 action research projects on procurement data and COVID-19</p>
<p>Alongside the current guidance and discussions of how best to use the IATI Standard, would we expect to also see something similar from “IATI” (board / secretariat / data use task force / publishers / donors), perhaps?</p>

          <title>Strengthening IATI data quality: towards a comprehensive user feedback system</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[markbrough]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Using IATI Data</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi all – cross posting here <a href="https://iatistandard.org/en/news/strengthening-iati-data-quality-towards-comprehensive-user-feedback-system/" rel="nofollow noopener">a blog just published on the IATI website</a> on our research (with <a class="mention" href="/u/claudia_schwegmann">@Claudia_Schwegmann</a>) around a user feedback mechanism for IATI data.</p>
<hr>
<p>Over the last ten years, a wide range of organisations have invested considerable efforts in publishing IATI data. However, the consensus is that there is still a need to increase and diversify the usage of IATI data. The new <a href="https://iatistandard.org/en/governance/iati-strategic-plan-2020-2025/" rel="nofollow noopener">IATI Strategic Plan (2020-2025)</a> commits to “develop feedback mechanisms so users can alert publishers to issues with their data”.</p>
<p><strong>Data Quality Feedback Mechanism project</strong></p>
<p>UNDP, on behalf of the <a href="https://iatistandard.org/en/using-data/how-iati-improves-data-use/" rel="nofollow noopener">IATI Data Use Task Force</a>, commissioned Catalpa to undertake research “to explore the opportunities for increasing the communication between data users and publishers, with the primary goal of improving the quality of IATI data”.</p>
<p>As agreed, the research will focus particularly on partner countries, but our aim is for the recommendations to be applicable to a broad set of IATI data users. Claudia Schwegmann is the lead author on this work, supported by myself and Anders Hofstee (<a href="https://procurement-notices.undp.org/view_file.cfm?doc_id=150081" rel="nofollow noopener">read UNDP’s Request For Proposal in full</a>).</p>
<p>While a range of different tools and processes currently exist to measure data quality, at the moment, there are limited avenues for individual users to provide feedback to publishers.</p>
<p>Last year UNDP conducted an IATI Data Use Survey, which found that 58% of publishers do not have any mechanism in place for “seeking or receiving feedback from users” of their published data - though 97% said they would be interested in receiving feedback on their data.</p>
<p>The survey showed that the remaining 42% of feedback received by publishers is principally via email. Email clearly has advantages as an established communications channel, but it also has its limitations. As feedback is not captured in a structured and systematic way across different users and different publishers, it is hard to curate and coordinate different users’ inputs, and there is no systematic way of tracking when publishers have resolved particular issues.</p>
<p>Over the coming weeks, we’ll be reaching out to a wide range of IATI stakeholders to understand how feedback on data could best be channeled back to publishers and made accessible to other data users, in a way that is most likely to lead to improvements in data quality. We’ll be sharing more information throughout this process, and you’re welcome to get in touch with us if you’d like to hear more about our work. Contact Claudia and myself by emailing <a href="mailto:cl.schwegmann@gmail.com">cl.schwegmann@gmail.com</a> and <a href="http://mark@brough.io/" rel="nofollow noopener">mark@brough.io</a> (or commenting below!)</p>

          <title>Making codelists more accessible</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[andylolz]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Using IATI Data</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>See below for the latest short post, cross-posted from <a href="https://codeforiati.org/blog/2020/02/10/making-third-party-codelists-more-accessible/" rel="nofollow noopener">the Code for IATI blog</a> – this time to launch our new <a href="https://codelists.codeforiati.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">replicated codelists website</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Making codelists more accessible</h1>
<p>When using IATI data, there are a number of reference codelists that are needed to make sense of the data. Some of these codelists are controlled by IATI directly, but others are controlled by a number of other organisations: for example, the <a href="https://reference.iatistandard.org/codelists/Country" rel="nofollow noopener">Country</a> codelist (the <a href="https://www.iso.org/obp/ui#iso:pub:PUB500001:en" rel="nofollow noopener">ISO-managed list of countries</a>) or the <a href="https://reference.iatistandard.org/codelists/Sector" rel="nofollow noopener">Sector</a> codelist (the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/development/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-standards/dacandcrscodelists.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">OECD DAC list of Purpose Codes</a>).</p>
<p>IATI maintains copies of these third-party codelists – called replicated codelists – but there are a number of reasons why, as users of IATI data, we would often have to construct our own versions directly from the source. We built the <a href="https://codelists.codeforiati.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">the replicated codelists interface</a> to share this work with others who could stand to benefit from it.</p>
<h2>Aims and additional functionality</h2>
<p>We had three main aims in building this new interface. We wanted to ensure that replicated codelists are:</p>
<ul>
<li>as up to date as possible;</li>
<li>provided in formats that are most useful for users of IATI data (including via an intuitive API);</li>
<li>accessible in multiple languages - initially in English and French, with scope to expand the range of supported languages depending on availability of translated codelists.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve gone through most of the replicated codelists to ensure they are fully up to date and consistent with the source, including adding in historical codes that have subsequently been withdrawn, and adding in official French translations. The entire interface can be switched from English to French (with thanks to <a class="mention" href="/u/yohannaloucheur">@YohannaLoucheur</a>!) and codelists can be downloaded in a range of formats (including Excel) in either language.</p>
<p>We added in a codelist for <a href="https://codelists.codeforiati.org/HumanitarianGlobalClusters/" rel="nofollow noopener">Humanitarian Global Cluster codes</a>, and a link to a separate set of work around <a href="https://codelists.codeforiati.org/ExchangeRates/" rel="nofollow noopener">exchange rates data</a> - vital reference data when working with IATI data. We made all codelists accessible through <a href="https://codelists.codeforiati.org/api/" rel="nofollow noopener">a simple API for developers</a>. Finally, we have a workflow in place to ensure that everything is kept up to date and consistent whenever the source codelists change.</p>
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>We already <a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Codelists-NonEmbedded/pulls" rel="nofollow noopener">sent our proposed updates to the underlying codelists to IATI</a>, who can decide whether they would like to incorporate these changes.</p>
<p>Let us know if you think this is useful for accessing codelists, and what else you think should be included! We have logged <a href="https://github.com/codeforIATI/codelists/issues" rel="nofollow noopener">a number of issues we plan to work on here</a>.</p>

          <title>Working with data in multiple currencies: exchange rates data</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[markbrough]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Using IATI Data</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>See below another short post cross-posted from <a href="https://codeforiati.org/blog/2020/02/03/working-with-data-multiple-currencies-exchange-rates-data/" rel="nofollow noopener">the Code for IATI blog</a> on some tools to make it easier to use data published in multiple currencies.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Working with data in multiple currencies: exchange rates data</h1>
<p>IATI data is published in different currencies by different organisations - data often comes out of each organisation’s own financial system. That’s great, because it provides a great deal of detail and precision, but it also presents a challenge for data users. In order to compare data published in different currencies, we need to convert to a common or “base” currency such as U.S. Dollars.</p>
<p>One option is to simply use annual averages, but in environments where currencies can vary substantially, this is not always accurate enough for the use case. As an alternative, there are services such as <a href="https://openexchangerates.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">Open Exchange Rates</a>, which even has a free plan, but with a limited number of requests allowed (1,000 per month). This can become problematic when dealing with very large datasets - the new IATI Datastore suggests there are currently about 4.5 million transactions in IATI data.</p>
<h2>Building a service for supporting use at country level</h2>
<p>For building IATI integrations in Bangladesh and Liberia, we therefore settled on another approach. We set <a href="https://morph.io/markbrough/exchangerates-scraper" rel="nofollow noopener">up a service</a> to extract exchange rates data from the <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/categories/94" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>U.S. Federal Reserve (FRED)</strong></a>, containing daily data for a number of currencies. It also captures monthly averages data from the <a href="https://stats.oecd.org/" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>OECD</strong></a> in a broader range of currencies and for a longer historical period, which can be used as a fallback option. The service checks for new data from both sources each night and puts all the data into a single dataset. This can either be downloaded as a spreadsheet, or accessed via an API which developers can query (for example, “give me only the new rates since the last time I checked”).</p>
<p>We also set up a <a href="https://exchangerates.codeforiati.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">simple online exchange rates calculator</a> so you can see how it works.</p>
<h2>Selecting the best rate from multiple sources</h2>
<p>As the dataset contains exchange rates data from multiple sources, we need some logic in the target system to decide which source to use. For example: we prefer FRED rates (as they are daily rates, and so more accurate), and then fall back to using OECD rates (which are monthly), if no FRED exchange rate is available within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>There are a couple of things that could potentially be useful to add. For example, we could incorporate more sources (e.g. IMF or AfDB rates), which could potentially also open up a number of additional currencies. Depending on exactly how the data from other sources is published, the maintenance could become a bit more challenging – everything works very smoothly and automatically at the moment, so we would be keen to keep things manageable to ensure everything is sustainable.</p>
<p>Let us know what you think below, or if you have specific bug reports or feature requests, <a href="https://github.com/codeforIATI/exchangerates-scraper/issues" rel="nofollow noopener">you can add them on the Github Issues page</a>.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I was browsing <a href="https://www.iatiregistry.org/dataset/plannlno-ao" rel="nofollow noopener">a dataset on the registry</a>, and saw for the first time (did I just miss it before?) some thematic tags, in this case “child rights” and “gender equality” - please can I ask where these come from, and what are they used for? Is there a codelist for the tags somewhere?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

          <title>D-Portal Visualization Issue</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[AVaughn]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Using IATI Data</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>USAID was reviewing a recent PWYF blog:<br>
(<a href="https://www.publishwhatyoufund.org/2019/06/tracking-humanitarian-spending-in-iraq/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.publishwhatyoufund.org/2019/06/tracking-humanitarian-spending-in-iraq/</a>) on tracking humanitarian spending and believe we’ve uncovered an issue with d-Portal.</p>
<p>We’re adding this issue to GitHub, but would appreciate others taking a look to see if others are finding this issue.</p>
<p>PWYF has issued an update on the blog, but we want to make sure this issue is also updated on d-Portal so that there isn’t a lack of trust in the data.</p>
<p>After examining the issue found in the PWYF blog, we found the immediate issue is that in d-Portal the first pie chart (no matter what you’re filtered on year wise) shows all years of data.  It appears on the USAID graph in the blog, the $723.6M for emergency response on the pie chart was used.  Again, however, this is a sum of all years of data.  When you click ‘view all’ and go into the table, you get around $300M for 2017 which is correct.  This is a feature of d-Portal that the first graph shows all years and not the year filtered on in the initial selection - the amount of emergency spend in 2017 was not higher than the total spend for Iraq (which is around $325M).</p>
<p>However, the real issue, as PWYF then pointed out to us, is that d-Portal notes that USAID disbursed $331.6M in Iraq in 2017, but it also says that USAID disbursed $418.4m of emergency response funds in Iraq in 2017. (See:  <a href="https://d-portal.org/ctrack.html?country=IQ&amp;year_min=2017&amp;year=2017&amp;year_max=2017&amp;year=2017#view=donors" rel="nofollow noopener">https://d-portal.org/ctrack.html?country=IQ&amp;year_min=2017&amp;year=2017&amp;year_max=2017&amp;year=2017#view=donors</a> and <a href="https://d-portal.org/ctrack.html?country=IQ&amp;sector_group=720&amp;year_min=2017&amp;year=2017&amp;year_max=2017&amp;year=2017#view=donors" rel="nofollow noopener">https://d-portal.org/ctrack.html?country=IQ&amp;sector_group=720&amp;year_min=2017&amp;year=2017&amp;year_max=2017&amp;year=2017#view=donors</a>)</p>
<p>The issue of emergency funding being larger than the reported total is an issue with the d-portal visualization.  For example, if you click on the total for USAID emergency funding (418,436,618) it will bring up a list of USAID activities.  Notice the second activity in the list, USAID/OFDA Grant for Iraq/Complex Emergency (AID-OFDA-IO-16-00109), reports a total of (44,273,300).  However if you then select that activity and total the disbursements listed for 2017, it is 22,136,660.  This is the correct amount.  This error is occurring with many, but not all of the USAID activities reported in that chart.</p>
<p>Additionally if you repeat this process for the chart that reports total USAID Irag spend, you will notice the total is reported correctly for this activity, hence why emergency funding totals are larger than the reported country totals.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/yohannaloucheur">@YohannaLoucheur</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/johnadams">@JohnAdams</a> - did you have a chance to review the PWYF blog and the Canada and DFID findings there?  Is the issue we describe also affecting your data on d-Portal?</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>We have reviewed the existing data store logs over the past 10 days:</p>
<ul>
<li>All API calls containing the string “recipient-country=” were analysed.</li>
<li>Bots and csv download requests were excluded</li>
<li>The content of the specific calls (often including reporting-org filters) was analysed</li>
<li>Follow-up queries to the possible originators of API calls were made</li>
</ul>
<p>We find that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only two developing countries and one donor (Sweden) are using the datastore in their production systems</li>
<li>Somalia automatically retrieves all activities a number of times each day</li>
<li>Bangladesh makes manually initiated calls for selected publishers on a random basis.</li>
<li>Rwanda is making a single invalid call every second day</li>
<li>Haiti and Malawi are making test calls from a staging server</li>
<li>There are a substantial number of non-country specific calls emanating from IP addresses in Belgium, South Korea and Russia</li>
</ul>
<p>Please contact us if you believe we have missed something.</p>
<p>We are planning to continue to monitor them for the next couple of weeks to inform our planning so that we can offer users the smoothest transition possible.</p>

            <p>Hi - I wondered if someone here knew the best contact for a DFID devtracker bug?</p>
<p>Now that devtracker shows FCO projects (great) unfortunately it seems to include non-active FCO projects in the default/initial view for a country - which is problematic as the default view has ‘active projects only’ set. They go away if you unset and then reset it to active projects.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/siemvaessen">@siemvaessen</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/iati-techteam">@IATI-techteam</a></p>
<p>Any chance of getting an update on the datastore progress/timeline? In particular, do you know when there will be a draft (or final) version of the API spec published?</p>
<p>The github <a href="https://github.com/zimmerman-zimmerman/OIPA/projects/2" rel="nofollow noopener">tracker</a> shows a lot of ‘todo’s’ but nothing ‘in progress’</p>
<p>Is there also confirmation of the date when the existing datastore will be switched off?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>When I use d-portal to search for projects for using a keyword search, a sector group, and a publishers the search tells me there are multiple activities but then when I click explore results there are 0 projects.</p>
<p>I have encountered this issue a week ago for World Bank and today for USAID, so I just checked and SIDA, DFID,  and Global Affairs Canada have this issue too, so I’m guessing it is a system wide glitch. This is a pretty big obstacle for use and trying to find a certain kind of project, and personally will be a big hindrance to data use work I am doing.</p>

          <title>Machine translation and secondary publishers</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[matmaxgeds]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Using IATI Data</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I had been thinking about machine translation of IATI a while back and the <a href="https://www.globaldevhub.org/iati-sp-2019-discussion-3#comment-19294" rel="nofollow noopener">recent discussion on</a> globaldevhub stimulated it again.</p>
<p>One issue that I came up against last time is that I had imagined that we would lookup the recipient country, cross-reference with a list of national languages, and then re-publish all the text fields in the national languages. However, my understanding was that republishing needs to be done as a ‘secondary-publisher’ but it is very difficult to see data from secondary publishers in any of the user-facing tools.</p>
<p>For example, I was just trying to see some secondary publishers in d-portal but don’t seem to be able to get them to come up in the publisher list. The FAQ says that they are excluded from the calculations but <a href="https://github.com/devinit/D-Portal/issues/156#issuecomment-61030207" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a> suggests that they should still be in the publisher list?</p>
<p>This isn’t really about d-portal, but a question asking for feedback on whether anyone can suggest whether there is going to be an easy route to end-users being able to see the machine translated data in order to decide whether setting up machine translation would be worth it (although it wouldn’t be that much effort).</p>
<p>Thoughts much appreciated,</p>
<p>Matt</p>

          <title>How do YOU explain double counting?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[stevieflow]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Using IATI Data</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi everyone</p>
<p>Every couple of months I host a session about “Using IATI data” with staff from the European Commission.  It’s very interesting to meet people who need data, and we get through a lot in the three hours.  It also includes a “d-portal quiz” (thanks to <a class="mention" href="/u/amys">@amys</a> for that idea - I’ll detail that in another thread)!</p>
<p>During the session, people get familiar with the concepts of IATI, and start to use the data.  d-portal is very useful, but we do also check other sites such as <a href="https://devtracker.dfid.gov.uk/" rel="nofollow noopener">devtracker</a> and <a href="https://openaid.se/aid/" rel="nofollow noopener">open SIDA</a>, plus pull spreadsheets out of the datastore, and even talk about IATI feeds into AIMS and FTS.</p>
<p>At some point in <em>every</em> session a participant will stop, reflect and then say something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>“<strong><em>hold on, if IATI is about different flows, and some of those are related, how do we avoid double counting?</em></strong>”</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll usually then reply with something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>“<strong><em>yes, good point! Well, the idea is that as activities are linked together by different publishers, data users will know not to add them together</em></strong>”</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes I explain this in a hopeful way.  At other times I find I’m more assertive.  At no times am I 100% confident!</p>
<p>Sometimes people accept this. Other times, there’s more questioning.  We often start to explore the model of publishing IATI, and that it doesn’t help us to consider it as a single database we sum together.  In all cases, it’s a rewarding conversation, albeit conceptually challenging (for me!)</p>
<p>With this in mind, I wanted to ask the brilliant people out there in our community: <strong>how do you describe double counting &amp; IATI?</strong></p>
<p>Have you a way of explaining it that works?  Do you have slides? Have you used props?  All ideas and experiences are gratefully accepted!</p>
<p>Lastly - please please <em>please</em>: let’s not defeat ourselves in this thread by trying to build or discuss a technical solution for double counting!  It’s a thing, and will be with us for a while.  What I’m specifically interested in is how we can explain (in words, pictures and hand gestures)it to others, as I think many of us have had to do this…</p>

          <title>Ambiguous guidance re. results (and a sanity check)</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[reidmporter]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Using IATI Data</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Had a question from a client today that sent me off on a rabbit chase…</p>
<hr>
<p>As a launching off point, in <a href="https://iatistandard.org/en/guidance/preparing-data/what-data-to-publish/" rel="nofollow noopener">the guidance on “What data should I publish?”</a>, it says that:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Data should be <strong>cumulative</strong>. If you’re publishing every quarter, each activity <em>should include data for the quarter being reported along with existing data from previous quarters</em>. This will also enable you to amend your existing data as necessary.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This threw me initially because I read too much into the term “cumulative”, but the text in italics makes clear that the intention of this guidance is to prevent publishers from removing historic data in subsequent updates. In other words, we’ve established that we want to make it easy for downstream data users to have full information with regards to the activity in question. Got it. Moving on…</p>
<hr>
<p>In <a href="http://reference.iatistandard.org/203/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/result/indicator/period/actual/" rel="nofollow noopener">the reference page for result/indicator/period/actual</a>, it states that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A record of the achieved result <em>for this period</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At first glance, my read is that this refers to <strong>incremental</strong> results, that which was achieved “for this period”. In other words, if I trained 5 people last year, but only 3 people this year, I would publish 3 as my actual for this year, not 8 (which would be the <strong>cumulative</strong> result, from the beginning of time to the current period). Then again, I wouldn’t fault anyone for interpreting this the other way, that the (cumulative) result “for this period” is 8, just as the result for the previous period was 5. Keep your finger on that minor ambiguity…</p>
<hr>
<p>In this Discuss post (which covers several issues related to results), <a class="mention" href="/u/pelleaardema">@pelleaardema</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the Netherlands Red Cross we keep track of changes over time by defining different periods for targets and actuals:</p>
<ul>
<li>the target is usually valid for the entire activity period (but it’s also possible to work with annual targets)</li>
<li>
<em>the actual values will reflect the progress made over a shorter period of time, e.g. a quarter</em>. In this case it is important that the <em>actual value shows the <strong>increment</strong> in that period, rather than the <strong>cumulative</strong> value.</em>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This explicitly states that at least one publisher out there uses incremental values rather than cumulative. In fact, DevResults clients also publish incremental results, which is all that our platform allows for at present. But…</p>
<hr>
<p>Both the <a href="https://www.government.nl/documents/publications/2015/12/01/open-data-and-development-cooperation" rel="nofollow noopener">Dutch</a> and the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dfid-iati-guidelines" rel="nofollow noopener">DFID</a> guidance (which many organizations use as their primary reference for what to publish) do two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Avoid stating explicitly whether they’re looking for cumulative or incremental results.</li>
<li>Include illustrative examples that are similarly ambiguous…</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="lang-xml"> &lt;period&gt;
  &lt;period-start iso-date=”2012-01-01” /&gt;
  &lt;period-end iso-date=”2015-12-31” /&gt;
  &lt;target value=”2000000”&gt;
   &lt;comment&gt;
    &lt;narrative&gt;
    In 2015, 2 mln people in Country X should have access to
    independent media on a regular basis (60% of the population)
    &lt;/narrative&gt;
   &lt;/comment&gt;
  &lt;/target&gt;
 &lt;/period&gt;
 &lt;period&gt;
  &lt;period-start iso-date=”2012-01-01” /&gt;
  &lt;period-end iso-date=”2012-12-31” /&gt;
  &lt;actual value=”300000”&gt;
   &lt;comment&gt;
    &lt;narrative&gt;
    Narrative explanation of the actual value, e.g. how it was
    reached, in which areas the most progress was made.
    &lt;/narrative&gt;
   &lt;/comment&gt;
  &lt;/actual&gt;
 &lt;/period&gt;
 &lt;period&gt;
  &lt;period-start iso-date=”2013-01-01” /&gt;
  &lt;period-end iso-date=”2013-12-31” /&gt;
  &lt;actual value=”500000”&gt;
   &lt;comment&gt;
    &lt;narrative&gt;
    Narrative explanation of the actual value, e.g. how it was
    reached, in which areas the most progress was made.
    &lt;/narrative&gt;
   &lt;/comment&gt;
  &lt;/actual&gt;
 &lt;/period&gt;
 &lt;period&gt;
  &lt;period-start iso-date=”2014-01-01” /&gt;
  &lt;period-end iso-date=”2014-12-31” /&gt;
  &lt;actual value=”1200000”&gt;
   &lt;comment&gt;
    &lt;narrative&gt;
    Narrative explanation of the actual value, e.g. how it was
    reached, in which areas the most progress was made.
    &lt;/narrative&gt;
   &lt;/comment&gt;
  &lt;/actual&gt;
 &lt;/period&gt;
&lt;/indicator&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>If you just look at the 3 actuals for 2012, 2013, and 2014 – 300,000 + 500,000 + 1,200,000 – you get exactly the target value (2,000,000), which <em>suggests</em> that the values should be considered as <strong>incremental</strong>, but alternatively, one could read these results as <strong>cumulative</strong> and determine that they have yet to achieve the target. (For the record, I’m sure whomever wrote this example was mostly illustrating what the elements mean rather than trying to illustrate how results should be interpreted, but even so, this is the most detail published in any authoritative source that I can find about whether results should be incremental or cumulative.)</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>SO!</strong> With all that in mind, my questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Am I missing something obvious and explicit about how publishers should publish indicator results by period? (I did initially look through the archives to see what the intention was when results and indicators were introduced, but gave up quickly:-)</li>
<li>If I’m not missing anything, is IATI’s guidance/reference in need of clarification?</li>
<li>If IATI intentionally avoided coming down on one side of incremental vs. cumulative, does that suggest that yet another attribute is needed in the standard to clarify how <code>&lt;indicator&gt;</code> actuals should be interpreted/aggregated?</li>
<li>
<strong>With regards to data use, what do we actually prefer?</strong> I assume it would be more straightforward for the entire world to agree that incremental results are where it’s at, as this would speed both manual aggregation (i.e. adding this period to last period at a glance or in Excel) as well as automated aggregation (i.e. in a data portal or analysis app). But that would suggest that we’re only interested in things that tend to move in only one direction - i.e. things we’ve done, outputs, etc. - and not metrics that can fluctuate up and down, because having a negative incremental result would be weird, right? Additionally, if donors are using IATI as progress reports, are they expecting to see cumulative or incremental results per period?</li>
<li>I’m tempted to ask if clarifying this ambiguity between incremental vs. cumulative was the/an intention behind <code>@aggregation-status</code>, but I know from other threads (which I can’t be bothered to locate at the moment) that there’s a host of known reasons why publishers say that results should/should not be aggregated - percentages, methodological inappropriateness, etc. Are these two threads at all related, or have I truly gone down the rabbit hole now?</li>
</ol>
<p>Would appreciate any clarity yall can bring to this situation: <a class="mention" href="/u/pelleaardema">@pelleaardema</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/stevieflow">@stevieflow</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/herman">@Herman</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/sjohns">@SJohns</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/mikesmith">@mikesmith</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/bill_anderson">@bill_anderson</a></p>

          <title>IATI data licensing (for unencumbered data use!)</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[andylolz]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Using IATI Data</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/stevieflow">@stevieflow</a>’s <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/iati-datastore-what-data-should-go-in/1631">recent datastore discuss post</a> raised some issues about IATI data licenses that we should aim to resolve, in order to facilitate unencumbered and unfettered data use.</p>
<p>For context, <a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Guidance/blob/4fc9723b/en/how-to-publish/establish-publishing-policies.rst#licensing">the licensing section of the publishing guidance</a> on the (old) IATI website says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The TAG secretariat, in collaboration with a small group chaired by the World Bank and including an open data/intellectual property lawyer, produced a set of recommendations for licensing. The IATI Licensing Standard, agreed in February 2011 at a meeting of signatories and the IATI Steering Committee, is that <strong>information published through the IATI standard should be licensed under an open license. It is a set of principles that must be adhered to</strong>, rather than a prescriptive set of terms and conditions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Emphasis mine. NB it looks like the above paragraph was <a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Guidance/pull/329">lost in the move</a> to the new <a href="http://iatistandard.org">iatistandard.org</a> site, and so it’s missing from <a href="https://iatistandard.org/en/guidance/preparing-organisation/organisation-data-publication/how-to-license-your-data/">the corresponding page</a>. Thanks to <a class="mention" href="/u/markbrough">@markbrough</a> for this institutional knowledge!)</p>
<p>So, here are four proposed action points aimed at providing a consistent approach to IATI data licensing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make data licenses mandatory for all new datasets in the registry (i.e. make it a required field, and remove the “Not specified” option). <a class="mention" href="/u/amys">@amys</a> has <a href="https://github.com/IATI/ckanext-iati/issues/229">already created a ticket for this</a>.</li>
<li>Improve the licensing guidance on the IATI site so that it is (i) self-consistent and clear that IATI data is open data (see: the contradictory wording that <a class="mention" href="/u/siemvaessen">@siemvaessen</a> <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/iati-datastore-what-data-should-go-in/1631/11">flags on discuss</a>) and (ii) provides a bit more explanation of why e.g. non-commercial (or closed more generally) is problematic.</li>
<li>Fix existing “closed” and “no license specified” data in the registry, by contacting publishers and asking them to select an open license. I guess if these aren’t updated <strong>after some pre-defined notice period</strong> (h/t <a class="mention" href="/u/stevieflow">@stevieflow</a>), these datasets would either need to default to an open license or be removed in order to be consistent with the IATI Licensing Standard.</li>
<li>Remove the closed license options from the “choose a license” dropdown on the registry.</li>

          <title>IATI Datastore - what data should go in?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[stevieflow]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Using IATI Data</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>As part of the build of the new IATI datastore, there’s an important point for our community to consider: <strong>what goes into the datastore</strong>?</p>
<p>A common response might be “<em>all published IATI data, surely?</em>”, but I wanted to offer an alternative, which I think others will support.</p>
<p>In short, I propose that the IATI datastore <em>initially</em> pulls in data that is:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Valid to the IATI schema, and;</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Published under an open licence, and;</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Using version 2.0x of IATI</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To be clear: this does not encompass all current published data. So - why limit ourselves? Here’s three reasons:</p>
<p><strong>1 - Schema validation is something we are very used to</strong></p>
<p>For those of us that grapple with data validation around IATI, we know it can often mean many things. The term “compliance with IATI” is often heard, but not universally agreed.</p>
<p>However, we have a very simple mechanism to help us: <strong><a href="http://reference.iatistandard.org/203/schema/" rel="nofollow noopener">the IATI schema</a></strong>. The schema provides exactness on how data should be ordered and structure: it’s the minimum level of validation one should pass.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://validator.iatistandard.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">online IATI validator</a> has always provided a means to test data against the schema. It’s true that there are a range of further “validation” tests one could make, including a host of rulesets and codelist checking - and even extending to the coherence of organisation identifiers. However, for us to get a basic level, we should begin by working with data that passes this initial schema inspection.</p>
<p>My argument here is simple: <em>if we start to support data that is not valid against the schema, why have a schema? Or even - what support are we giving to data users, if we supply invalid data?</em></p>
<p><strong>2 - Data licencing supports data use</strong></p>
<p>You might be surprised to see mention of data licencing in this proposal, as it can often be something that is added at the last moment of publication, whilst someone sets up their IATI Registry account. However, appropriate data licencing is an absolute must if we are to support people to successfully use IATI data.</p>
<p>In fact, we should really consider the datastore as a data user! In this light, it needs to be clear that they can access data under a licence that is permissive and open. When data is licenced under restricted grounds, then it cannot be reused (as that is what the licence says!).</p>
<p>My challenge: <em>Why would we support the datastore to use data that has no licence for reuse?</em></p>
<p><strong>3 - Version 1 of the standard is deprecated</strong></p>
<p>The TAG meeting in Kathmandu supported the decision of IATI members to deprecate version 1 of the standard, <a href="https://iatistandard.org/en/news/notice-deprecation-of-version-1-of-the-iati-standard/" rel="nofollow noopener">meaning that from June 2019 publishers using this will not be supported</a>.</p>
<p>Whilst it’s technically possible to convert data from version 1 to version 2 of the IATI standard, this would take up a limited resource on the datastore project we could deploy elsewhere.</p>
<p>My rationale: <em>to get the support of the new datastore, organisations need to supply data in a version that is actively supported by the initiative.</em></p>
<p><strong>Support for our principles?</strong></p>
<p>A common thread between these three conditions is mutual support. We all want to support our data standard and data users via the datastore project. To do this, we must ensure that we respect the core protocols we have around the schemas, licences and versions for our standard. Given that the datastore represents a renewed focus on data quality and use, I can’t imagine a scenario where we would actively go against these.</p>
<p>Of course, there are currently a range of publishing organisations that would be omitted from inclusion in the datastore, in terms of <a href="http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/validation.html" rel="nofollow noopener">failed schema tests</a>, <a href="http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/license/cc-nc.html" rel="nofollow noopener">restrictive licencing</a> and/or use of <a href="http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/versions.html" rel="nofollow noopener">unsupported versions</a>,. However, we should be careful to not start to cite examples in order to find reason for a relaxation of this criteria. I do believe this is a relatively low bar for entry - and that our community and tech team can provide positive support to those that need to remedy their data.</p>
<p><strong>What next?</strong> I’m hoping those active in our community can support these principles, so that we can in turn endorse the data that makes its way into the datastore. Maybe respond with a quick nod of a approval to get us moving on…</p>
<p>My <em>guess</em> (based on informal discussions - see below) is that the first two principles are very agreeable, whilst there’s a dilemma about use of version 1 data.  That seems fine - and is a reason for my separating v1 into a new point.</p>
<p>After this, we can start to extend our discussions around data validity, compliance and quality in other, more advanced, ways.  But, I do hope colleagues are able to step back and <strong>agree that this initial benchmark is for the betterment of the initiative</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Disclosure</em>: prior to posting this I quickly discussed these ideas with <a class="mention" href="/u/bill_anderson">@bill_anderson</a>, <a class="mention" href="/u/katehughes">@KateHughes</a>, <a class="mention" href="/u/herman">@Herman</a>  <a class="mention" href="/u/siemvaessen">@siemvaessen</a> , <a class="mention" href="/u/andylolz">@andylolz</a>, <a class="mention" href="/u/markbrough">@markbrough</a> &amp; <a class="mention" href="/u/rory_scott">@rory_scott</a> - more as an valued and accessible sounding board rather than definitive answer (but thanks, nevertheless!)!</p>

          <title>Iatisplit - split very large IATI activity files</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[David_Megginson]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Using IATI Data</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I’ve just released v0.2 of <strong>iatisplit</strong>, a public-domain command-line utility for splitting very large IATI activity reports into smaller ones. This utility can process a very large IATI file in a few seconds, with constant memory usage (so it’s quite reasonable to try it with a 100+MB IATI file, though I haven’t found one yet).</p>
<p>To install, you need Python3 on your system. You can either install from the source on GitHub, or use</p>
<blockquote>
<p>$ pip install iatisplit</p>
</blockquote>
<p>from the command line. After that, usage looks like this (to split into files with a maximum of 200 activities each):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>$ iatisplit -n 200 -d my-output-directory/ big-iati-file.xml</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(You can also provide a URL.)</p>
<p>Now there is no excuse for any system to have a size limit for importing IATI data. <img src="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>There are a bunch of things that I am looking forward to in the new datastore that are probably out of the scope of the <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/terms-of-reference-for-a-new-iati-datastore/1293">ToR</a>so with <a class="mention" href="/u/siemvaessen">@siemvaessen</a>’s permission,  I wanted to start a wishlist so that we can all vote on which to prioritise.</p>
<p>My list includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Compressed XML data dump - following <a class="mention" href="/u/andylolz">@andylolz</a> <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/show-iati-download-a-daily-snapshot-of-all-iati-data/1362">here</a> as I think this is so useful it should be  a core IATI product.</li>
<li>Ability to query all aspects of the IATI standard e.g. sometimes I want to return any activities reporting by <a href="http://reference.iatistandard.org/203/codelists/SectorVocabulary/" rel="nofollow noopener">COFOG</a>
</li>
<li>Able to return the raw XML for any activities meeting the search.</li>
<li>Able to query the file metadata</li>
<li>Able to query the organisation files (as prep for the changes hinted at in the ‘enriching the organisation file’ TAG presentation</li>
<li>Ability to filter by various markers (esp. humanitarian) from <a class="mention" href="/u/david_megginson">@David_Megginson</a>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If people add other ideas, <s>I think I can add them to the poll - or </s> perhaps there is a better way to organise this?</p>

          <title>Using IATI data - uniquely identifying transactions</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[stevieflow]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Using IATI Data</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi everyone</p>
<p>I wanted to share something <a class="mention" href="/u/david_megginson">@David_Megginson</a> &amp; <a class="mention" href="/u/ximboden">@ximboden</a> encountered via importing IATI data into the Financial Tracking System (FTS).</p>
<p>This might is an issue that some may have hit before.  It’d be great to hear from others who <strong><em>regularly</em></strong> ingest IATI data into their projects, to understand if this is a headache, or not, or whether you have a workaround.  Thinking of <a class="mention" href="/u/herman">@Herman</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/markbrough">@markbrough</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/tdavis">@tdavis</a>  <a class="mention" href="/u/siemvaessen">@siemvaessen</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/matmaxgeds">@matmaxgeds</a> and others…</p>
<p><strong>Scenario</strong></p>
<p>With FTS, we want to import IATI activities, to construct Flows.  A (obvious) vital cog to this is the IATI transaction.</p>
<p>We also know that IATI publishers will be adding transactions to their activities over time - which is expected behavior.</p>
<p>So -</p>
<ul>
<li>On first import an activity has <strong>two transactions</strong>.</li>
<li>When the activity is updated, a month later, two more transactions have been added by the publisher.  The activity now has <strong>four transactions</strong>.</li>
<li>When we import the updated activity, we know it’s some data we’ve encountered before, because the <code>activity-identifier</code> is present.  That’s helpful!</li>
<li>However, the transactions have no identifier.  Our import now gives us <strong>six transactions</strong> (the first two, plus the new four)!</li>
</ul>
<p>I can picture people frowning at this!  Of <em>course</em>, our system and data import routines <em>could</em> have some extra process to generate and store a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function" rel="nofollow noopener">hash of the data</a>, for example - or even check the transactions dates and values etc etc.  We understand that, but the point is: <strong>do we think it efficient to shift this overhead from the publisher to data users, each of whom would have to work out the problem and compute a workaround?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A solution</strong></p>
<p>The IATI <code>transaction</code> element does actually include a <span class="mention">@ref</span> attribute, which could be use to declare an identifier for a transaction.  For example:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;transaction ref="1"&gt;
&lt;transaction ref="2"&gt;
&lt;transaction ref="3"&gt;
&lt;transaction ref="4"&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Or, more verbosely:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;transaction ref="EX-AMPLE-ORG-ACTIVITY100-transaction1"&gt;
&lt;transaction ref="EX-AMPLE-ORG-ACTIVITY100-transaction2"&gt;
&lt;transaction ref="EX-AMPLE-ORG-ACTIVITY100-transaction3"&gt;
&lt;transaction ref="EX-AMPLE-ORG-ACTIVITY100-transaction4"&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Or even:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;transaction ref="oranges"&gt;
&lt;transaction ref="apples"&gt;
&lt;transaction ref="pears"&gt;
&lt;transaction ref="cashews"&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>(OK, that last example isn’t advisable, but <a class="mention" href="/u/reidmporter">@reidmporter</a> might like it)</p>
<p>For our import to FTS, we know this solution actually works!  When publishers include a <span class="mention">@ref</span>, it acts as an identifier we can check, to understand if this is a transaction we’ve seen before.</p>
<p>We are aware of scenarios such as transactions being edited, or data being added to a transaction (a receiver-org activity-identifier, for example), but would appreciate we try and stick to the main point here: <strong>should we strive to include a <span class="mention">@ref</span> that can act as a transaction identifier within any activity, to help data users?</strong></p>
<p>It’d be great to hear from others.</p>

          <title>How useful is the Registry &quot;Data Search&quot;?</title>

          <category>Using IATI Data</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>It would be great to hear if anyone <strong><em>relies</em></strong> on the IATI Registry “<a href="https://www.iatiregistry.org/dataset" rel="nofollow noopener">Data Search</a>”, and specifically the file-level set up that some publishers follow: one IATI XML file per recipient-country.</p>
<p>The underlying logic, which I think has been in place since day one of IATI, is that the Data Search can give us all <strong>files</strong> that are about a certain recipient country, for example these 46 files for Bangladesh:</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/original/1X/5c944145366f1b39fd09ca14359fcac324eeec55.png" data-download-href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/5c944145366f1b39fd09ca14359fcac324eeec55" title="download (10).png"><img src="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/5c944145366f1b39fd09ca14359fcac324eeec55_2_690x184.png" alt="download%20(10)" width="690" height="184" srcset="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/5c944145366f1b39fd09ca14359fcac324eeec55_2_690x184.png, https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/original/1X/5c944145366f1b39fd09ca14359fcac324eeec55.png 1.5x, https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/original/1X/5c944145366f1b39fd09ca14359fcac324eeec55.png 2x" data-small-upload="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/5c944145366f1b39fd09ca14359fcac324eeec55_2_10x10.png"><div class="meta">

</div></a></div></p>
<p>However - I think it’s well-known that this search is not definitive.</p>
<p>If we check d-portal (for example) we can see that <a href="http://d-portal.org/ctrack.html?search&amp;country=BD#view=main" rel="nofollow noopener">185 publishers</a> actually have <strong>activities</strong> with this same recipient-country:</p>

</div></a></div></p>
<p>This is a big mismatch.  It’s because many publishers might include all their activities in one / a few file(s) (Netherlands <a class="mention" href="/u/herman">@Herman</a>; Canada <a class="mention" href="/u/yohannaloucheur">@YohannaLoucheur</a> ) or also have multi-country activities that may be in a regional file (DFID <a class="mention" href="/u/johnadams">@JohnAdams</a>).</p>
<p>Therefore - what’s the point of the XML file-per-country and/or the IATI Registry Data Search?  Does this actively help data users?</p>
<p>Added to this, is that the recipient-country filter on the Registry is populated with quite a few non-obvious entries:</p>

<p>Thoughts welcome.  I can understand how something like the Datastore might eventually fix this, but we should also think about the Here and Now: there might be someone trying to use IATI data and quickly finding this not useful.</p>
