          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>As has been pointed out by <a class="mention" href="/u/michelle_iom">@Michelle_IOM</a> in <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/using-related-activity-to-link-data-between-different-publishers/288/15">another post</a> it is already possible for donor and recipients to cross reference each other and the IATI Standard does already make provision for that to happen. However, as <a class="mention" href="/u/herman">@Herman</a> had mentioned (and it was also my understanding) I think that the original intention for traceability within IATI was just to trace upwards within the funding chain? Both <a class="mention" href="/u/herman">@Herman</a> and <a class="mention" href="/u/yohannaloucheur">@YohannaLoucheur</a> have pointed out that a donor or funder can generally provide their own originating IATI activity identifier to the recipient via contract documentation and/ or as part of the contract management business process etc .</p>
<p>Interestingly, some of our most recent work within the Grand Bargain (particularly around issues relating to Localisation) is highlighting that there would indeed be value in being to be able to trace both ‘up’ and ‘down’ the funding chain. Presumably for this it happen, Donors and other funders would need to regularly ‘harvest’ the recipient activity identifiers and add them into their own systems. I think this process could certainly be automated and it would also provide donors with an automatic confirmation or validation that recipients have also now published the receipt of that funding to IATI? As a result I would be very interested to hear any views from donors or others on the practicalities and appetite (or lack of?) for making this happen?</p>

          <title>Organisation playing different roles - what to publish?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[AnnaPe]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Traceability</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I’m writing to ask for an advice on how to publish an activity - the difficulty is the ActionAid UK (AAUK) is playing different roles along the delivery chain and therefore I’m not sure what to publish.</p>
<p>ActionAid Rwanda (AAR) is currently holding an AidDirect contract with DFID (via MannionDaniels) – they have reported the activity to IATI and you can see it on d-portal (<a href="http://www.d-portal.org/ctrack.html?publisher=RW-RGB-61-RGB-NGO-2017#view=act&amp;aid=RW-RGB-61-RGB-NGO-2017-SPK00" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.d-portal.org/ctrack.html?publisher=RW-RGB-61-RGB-NGO-2017#view=act&amp;aid=RW-RGB-61-RGB-NGO-2017-SPK00</a>).</p>
<p>As you will see ActionAid UK (AAUK) is playing a dual role: both implementing and extending as the project is also funded by other income sources raised by AAUK (PPL and Other major donors). I am now preparing to publish AAUK side of the activity but I’m not entirely sure what to do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Shall I just publish AAUK as accountable/implementer, with AAR as funding org.</li>
<li>Shall I publish AAUK as accountable/implementer, with AAR as funding org, and also AAUK as extending, with PPL and Major Donors as funding and AAR as accountable/implementer</li>
</ol>
<p>I feel like the second option might cause more confusion than anything as it would be difficult to reconcile the budget, which would only be related to the funds coming in from AAR to AAUK, with the incoming commitments, incoming funds and disbursements, which would also include money coming into AAUK and remitted to AAR. AAUK’s dual role would be represented on the main activity.</p>
<p>Any thoughts/advice/ideas would be much appreciated!</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Anna</p>

          <title>Extending organisation role: common usage?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[SJohns]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Traceability</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello, I’m looking for examples of common usage for the Extending organisation role. Does anyone use it in their data, or know of organisations that use it?</p>
<p>As a reminder, the <a href="https://www.bond.org.uk/effectiveness/open-information-and-ngos" rel="nofollow noopener">IATI guidance</a> states that an extending organisation is:</p>
<p><strong>An organisation that manages the budget and direction of an activity on behalf of the funding organisation.</strong></p>
<p>What I want to find out what does common usage look like? For example:</p>
<ol>
<li>Where the funding and extending organisation are part of the same organisation (ie govt departments are extending, the govt Treasury is the funding organisation or a local office of an NGO is disbursing funds on behalf of a central office).</li>
<li>Where an organisation is contracted as a fund manager for another funding organisation and managing disbursements.</li>
</ol>
<p>And how in practice are publishers differentiating from the Accountable role?</p>
<p><strong>An organisation responsible for oversight of the activity and its outcomes</strong></p>
<p>Hope people are happy to share their examples - posting a link to the activity on d-portal would be great.</p>
<p>(Please note that I’m looking for examples of where organisations are already using it in their data, rather than theoretical discussion - hope that’s ok!)</p>

          <title>IATI Dashboard - metric on traceability does not include Incoming Commitments (or Pledges)</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[stevieflow]]></dc:creator>

            <p>Taking a look at the publishing statistics and the <a href="http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/comprehensiveness_financials.html#h_narrative" rel="nofollow noopener">specific metric on traceability</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the data at the publishers’ lowest hierarchy, the percentage of current activities containing a transaction of type Incoming Funds that also contain the IATI identifier for the funding organisation’s activity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All transactions of @type=IF (1.xx) or @type=1 (2.xx) must contain provider-org/<span class="mention">@provider-activity-id</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Should the inclusion of <code>Incoming Funds</code> be wider, to include <code>Incoming Commitment</code> and even <code>Incoming Pledge</code> ?  In theory, it’s possible to include provider-org details, and link back to an existing activity, even when funds have not been disbursed.  Does that count as traceability?</p>
<p>Maybe there’s a specific reason for just <code>Incoming Funds</code> though?</p>

          <title>Correct use of organisation role and co-funding</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Melinda]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Traceability</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>We are having some discussions internally on how to use the organisation role. Let’s say that we have three organisations funding an activity, these three would have the role: 1, correct?  If our organisation is responsible for this pot of money and for directing it further, then we are the accountable organisation, role 2. Or are we merely extending, role 3? Is it the implementing organisation, role 4, that also carries the responsibility for the activity and the outcome?</p>

          <title>Tracing transactions: a first draft at an extension</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[rory_scott]]></dc:creator>

            <h3>Motivation &amp; Context</h3>
<p>I recently worked on some data that was, in essence, one activity which had multiple incoming funds transactions, each of which linked to several disbursements by a reference, in a 1:M relationship.</p>
<p>I realised that although there isn’t a formal way to link them in the standard (and there are plenty of good reasons not to want there to be), it might be interesting to link these transactions within one activity, rather than having to break them out into different activities and hierarchies, which is the convention.</p>
<p>The idea is that by looking at even just one activity, you could do some analysis and find out the internal financial workings of an activity, and plot something like this:</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/original/1X/71a4721c96b1da3a9179f2afad2da5a6e94fe40c.png" data-download-href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/71a4721c96b1da3a9179f2afad2da5a6e94fe40c" title="sankeymatic_1200x1200.png"><img src="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/71a4721c96b1da3a9179f2afad2da5a6e94fe40c_2_500x500.png" width="500" height="500" srcset="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/71a4721c96b1da3a9179f2afad2da5a6e94fe40c_2_500x500.png, https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/71a4721c96b1da3a9179f2afad2da5a6e94fe40c_2_750x750.png 1.5x, https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/71a4721c96b1da3a9179f2afad2da5a6e94fe40c_2_1000x1000.png 2x" data-small-upload="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/71a4721c96b1da3a9179f2afad2da5a6e94fe40c_2_10x10.png"><div class="meta">
<svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">sankeymatic_1200x1200.png</span><span class="informations">1200×1200 138 KB</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg>
</div></a></div></p>
<p>This could simplify things quite a bit, and could make it easier to mitigate double counting.</p>
<p>This use-case is in addition to linking transactions <em>between activities from one publisher</em>, and linking transactions <em>between publishers</em>.</p>
<h3>First go at an extension</h3>
<p>I decided to detail these use-cases alongside the technical implementation of an extension to the IATI standard in <a href="https://gist.github.com/rory09/bc89d2e581fe944aed2f1455da565611" rel="nofollow noopener">this gist</a>. I don’t expect there to be a huge amount of usage, but I’d be interested to hear what people think.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do we as a community anticipate being serious desire for something like this at some point, either from ourselves or from our users?</li>
<li>Have I missed anything obvious about how this would work? If so, suggestions are welcome.</li>
</ul>

          <title>Multiple country offices that are part of a single corporate entity - identify as org or only in country code?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[DanielMackenzie]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Traceability</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I’m looking for some guidance on how to report transfers of funds to country offices that are part of a single corporate entity.</p>
<p>IRC UK disburses money to IRC Inc. All IRC country offices that implement projects are a part of the same corporate structure - IRC Inc. - and thus share the same organisation identifier. Therefore, according the IRC IATI data, money is transferred to a range of countries (using the Country Code) but almost exclusively to one organisation (with a US corporate identifier).</p>
<p>Perhaps it is not a problem (as we can identify funds to countries), but it seems to undermine traceability if we cannot represent a relationship between organisations using the Reporting-org or Transaction elements.</p>
<p>Can we identify individual country offices by creating IATI org identifiers that only correspond to IATI, e.g US-EIN-13-5660870-SL (IRC Inc. org id + country code)?</p>
<p>Are there any other tips on how to go about this? Happy to explain further if it’s not clear.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Daniel</p>

          <title>Using participating-org to label cross-government funds</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[JohnAdams]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Traceability</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Most DFID projects are funded from DFID core funding (parliamentary vote). However DFID and other UK government bodies can also bid for funding from cross-government international development funds, such as Prosperity Fund, Conflict, Stabilisation and Security Fund (CSSF), Empowerment Fund, Ross Fund, Newton Fund.</p>
<p>These cross-government funds need to be clearly labelled in our open data (IATI) and on DevTracker, so that data users are aware of the difference between projects funded by these funds or from core funding.</p>
<p>We propose the following approach to clarify this for both core funding and cross-government funds, and would appreciate any feedback.</p>
<h2>Core funding</h2>
<p>This will label the core funds element as from DFID. This is a similar pattern to that used by other national donors, for example The Netherlands.</p>
<p>Funding organisation - DFID core funds</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>&lt;participating-org ref="GB-GOV-1" type="10" role="1"&gt;
&lt;narrative&gt;Department for International Development (core funds)&lt;/narrative&gt;
&lt;/participating-org&gt;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Accountable org - DFID - note the relabel of this element to “accountable”.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>&lt;participating-org ref="GB-GOV-1" type="10" role="2"&gt;
&lt;narrative&gt;Department for International Development&lt;/narrative&gt;
&lt;/participating-org&gt;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<h2>Cross-government funds</h2>
<p>For cross-government funds, we will specify the fund used as the source.</p>
<p>Our options are broadly:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Separate <strong>organisation</strong> for each of the Funds. This has the advantage that the participating-org is a specific organisation. However there is a risk that this does not match reality of the organisations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Separate <strong>activity</strong> for each of the Funds, managed by the responsible organisation (FCO, HMT, BEIS) and referred to in the participating-org field.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Option 2 makes more sense. Is this a similar approach to other funding models like Trust Funds?</p>
<p>Option 1 - Funding <strong>organisation</strong> - Prosperity Fund</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>&lt;participating-org ref="GB-GOV-xx" type="10" role="1"&gt;
&lt;narrative&gt;UK Government Prosperity Fund&lt;/narrative&gt;
&lt;/participating-org&gt;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Preferred option 2 - Funding <strong>activity</strong> - Prosperity Fund as part of HMT</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>&lt;participating-org ref="GB-GOV-xx" type="10" role="1" activity-id=”GB-GOV-xx-ProsperityFund”&gt; 
&lt;narrative&gt;UK Government Prosperity Fund&lt;/narrative&gt;
&lt;/participating-org&gt;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Accountable org - DFID</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>&lt;participating-org ref="GB-GOV-1" type="10" role="2"&gt; 
&lt;narrative&gt;Department for International Development&lt;/narrative&gt;
&lt;/participating-org&gt;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<h2>Questions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Does this model make sense?</li>
<li>Is it consistent with similar funding models in other areas (trust funds etc)?</li>
</ol>

            <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>At the IATI TAG we had a constructive discussion about representing Trust Funds in IATI.</p>
<p>See below the model that I presented during the session, based on the principles in the Netherlands IATI publication guidelines (available <a href="https://www.government.nl/binaries/government/documents/publications/2015/12/01/open-data-and-development-cooperation/how-to-use-the-iati-standard-1.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a> (English) and <a href="https://www.government.nl/binaries/government/documents/publications/2016/12/15/how-to-use-the-iati-standard-dutch-publication-guidelines-for-implementing-partners-in-french/Comment+utiliser+la+norme+IITA+-+Directives+NL.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a> (French).</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/original/1X/ec62cbd9bbe70877ce658fdec0f12c86084344ef.png" data-download-href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/ec62cbd9bbe70877ce658fdec0f12c86084344ef" title="Trust and pooled funds v01.png"><img src="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/ec62cbd9bbe70877ce658fdec0f12c86084344ef_2_666x500.png" width="666" height="500" srcset="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/ec62cbd9bbe70877ce658fdec0f12c86084344ef_2_666x500.png, https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/original/1X/ec62cbd9bbe70877ce658fdec0f12c86084344ef.png 1.5x, https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/original/1X/ec62cbd9bbe70877ce658fdec0f12c86084344ef.png 2x" data-small-upload="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/ec62cbd9bbe70877ce658fdec0f12c86084344ef_2_10x10.png"><div class="meta">

<p>In this case Organisation B is the organisation that manages the Trust Fund (Activity B). The Fund has 2 donors: Donor A and Donor D.<br>
The Trust Fund supports multiple activities, managed through activities B1 and B2 and implemented by external partners - in this case Organisation C.</p>
<p>The IATI elements needed to represent this structure are added below.</p>

</div></a></div></p>
<p>During the TAG there seemed to be consensus about this model, but looking forward to hearing your thoughts now that you’ve been able to think about it a bit longer.</p>

            <p>I’m hoping people can join in - and even call me out as wrong  - on this thread.  I’ve purposely written it this way…!</p>
<p>Traceability: what we think happens:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Donor A</strong> publishes a Disbursement of £100, on the 1st Feb 2017.</li>
<li>This transaction has a reference: 12345</li>
<li>They use receiver-org to clearly identify that Organisation B is destination of the funds</li>
<li>They also use receiver-activity-id to point to a specific IATI activity, published by Organisation B, that receives the fund</li>
</ul>
<p>and</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Organisation B</strong> also publishes IATI data, which includes an Incoming Fund for £100 on 1st Feb 2017</li>
<li>This transaction has a reference: 12345</li>
<li>They indicate that the provider-org is Donor A, and also include the provider-activity-id to signal that the source of the funds is an activity published by Donor A</li>
</ul>
<p>Together, this looks like <strong>great traceability</strong>.  We can connect two organisations together, alongside their activities, via a couple of transaction.</p>
<p>But!  The transactions are not <em><strong>actually</strong></em> linked together.  Each publisher can provide their internal reference for the transaction, but it’s not possible to cite other transaction references, in the same way we can for organisations and activities.</p>
<p>This might seem like nitpicking.  After all, the above two transactions <em>look</em> like they link together.  All available parts of the standard are in place, so <em>good enough,</em> right?</p>
<p>At a human level - eyeballing the data - we can probably make the assumption that this D is connected to the IF.   But (and this is a reason for our standard) how can a machine read and connect them?</p>
<p>This becomes tricky when - for example - the values of the transactions don’t match, for various reasons.  I have been discussing with one organisation how they receive a single IF from a donor, and then make several D to partners, from that.  It’s possible to see this in their accounting system, but when expressed via IATI, it’s difficult to then match things up - particularly when there are multiple transactions flowing in and out.</p>
<p>More fundamentally, we might want to ask: <strong>is this important for the IATI community?  Are we concerned about tracing and linking <em>specific</em> transactions together?  Or - can we accept that traceability in IATI will not be so <em>precise</em>?</strong></p>
<p>And - do post an alternative take on this, if you have one.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Two weeks ago <a class="mention" href="/u/vincentvw">@VincentVW</a> and discussed joining forces to do some work on traceability (and it’s close cousin, avoiding double counting). One of the approaches we will try is to work through some projects manually. The aim would be to try and figure out more clearly, where the issue is a data quality one, and where it is an issue of needed to adjust the standard.</p>
<p>To do this we need to find examples of projects which are ‘as good as it gets’ e.g. which have two donors, and two implementers, all of whom are IATI publishers, and all of whom have good ‘data quality’.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Matt</p>

            <p>Hi everyone</p>
<p>I’ve recently been working with UN-Habitat to investigate traceability: how we can link/connect different activities together.</p>
<p>There seems to be a growing community of people interested in this - including <a class="mention" href="/u/pelleaardema">@pelleaardema</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/herman">@Herman</a> and the team at the Dutch MFA (their <a href="https://www.government.nl/documents/publications/2015/12/01/open-data-and-development-cooperation" rel="nofollow noopener">guidelines</a> are very useful), <a class="mention" href="/u/rolfkleef">@rolfkleef</a> (really interesting post on <a href="https://www.drostan.org/2016/02/examining-structures-in-iati/" rel="nofollow noopener">org structures</a>) and <a class="mention" href="/u/sjohns">@SJohns</a> (fusion tables <a href="http://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/using-iati-data-to-create-network-visualisations/399/2">network diagrams</a>)</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/system">@system</a> Admin - could we have a new dedicated category for traceability, maybe?</p>
<p>My question here is what shared understanding or experience we might have in terms of how traceability might “look”.  If we tour around the uses of IATI thus far, there are plenty of maps, graphs and aggregations - most often centred on a single publisher (or all publishers, but aggregations around sectors or countries).  As far as I know, we haven’t anything out there to illustrate what traceability <strong><em>between</em></strong> publishers would be/mean…</p>
<p>Network diagrams might be one tactic - as could a Sankey diagram:</p>

<p>(made with <a href="http://sankeymatic.com/build/" rel="nofollow noopener">Sankeymatic</a>)</p>
<p>But - maybe we haven’t a clear idea, or full discussion, around what we are trying to do?  Is it best to consider why we want traceability before rushing to the tools?</p>
<p>Hopefully others in the community can discuss.  Apologies for the open end / vague nature of the post - I’ve been looking at network diagrams for far too long!</p>

          <category>Traceability</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>We want to use IATI data to create a network visualisation of the connections between funders, international NGOs and local NGOs. For us, this is about spotting where organisations are clustering rather than collaborating within a specific context or country as well as seeing how they link up. A very basic example is here: <a href="https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=1VfPqITAxt2rzZTBRXlcr0YlaDfIToX1us0atuss8" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=1VfPqITAxt2rzZTBRXlcr0YlaDfIToX1us0atuss8</a> (Chart 1 tab). This is data on organisations working on international development in Nepal. The viz shows the relationship between the funding organisations and the implementing organisations, weighted by total disbursements. We wanted to see if there were any patterns, for example, organisations receiving funding (orange node) from more than one funder (blue node).</p>
<p>I just wondered if you had any advice about things to be careful of, when creating a network visualisation. We can cut the data in very different ways, which mean the story we tell will also be different. And the quality of the data will also affect this - for example, there are funders who do not name implementing organisations - you can see this by the big orange blob connected to many funders. This network viz also shows that where organisations have different names in the data (DFID and Department for International Development), they appear as different nodes. If there any other ‘gotchas’ that we should watch for  based on your experience, it would be really useful to know this. Thank you IATI Community!</p>
