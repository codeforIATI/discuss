          <title>Challenge: results with multiple indicators and multiple measures</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I’m working with an organisation who wish to publish results data.</p>
<p>For any indicator, there will be multiple measurements (periods) that provide target and actuals, like this:</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/original/1X/ee1a6a368c1d4000d814b288873a1885d64c4c2a.png" data-download-href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/ee1a6a368c1d4000d814b288873a1885d64c4c2a" title="results.png"><img src="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/ee1a6a368c1d4000d814b288873a1885d64c4c2a_2_690x183.png" alt="results" width="690" height="183" srcset="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/ee1a6a368c1d4000d814b288873a1885d64c4c2a_2_690x183.png, https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/original/1X/ee1a6a368c1d4000d814b288873a1885d64c4c2a.png 1.5x, https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/original/1X/ee1a6a368c1d4000d814b288873a1885d64c4c2a.png 2x" data-small-upload="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/ee1a6a368c1d4000d814b288873a1885d64c4c2a_2_10x10.png"><div class="meta">
<svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">results.png</span><span class="informations">826×220 19 KB</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg>
</div></a></div></p>
<p>The standard allows this:</p>
<ul>
<li>a result can have one or more <a href="http://iatistandard.org/202/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/result/indicator/" rel="nofollow noopener">indicator</a>
</li>
<li>any indicator can have more than one <a href="http://iatistandard.org/202/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/result/indicator/period/" rel="nofollow noopener">period</a> (which then holds the target and actual data)</li>
</ul>
<p>So far so good.  But… how do we actually maintain this data, for the production of IATI.  And then - use it!</p>
<p>Missing in the schema is the ability to somehow <em>identify</em> the result(s) and indicator(s), meaning that whilst you might want to say in the above model:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the actual value 100 relates to the period Q2 1617, and contributes to Indicator A, which is a part of Result 1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It doesn’t seem possible to declare the concepts of Result 1 and Indicator A.</p>
<p>(<em>the ref attribute of transaction might be a good analogy here</em>)</p>
<p>This becomes a real difficulty when you’re managing data on <em>multiple</em> activities, all with <em>many</em> results, <em>a range of</em> indicators and <em>various</em> measurement periods.</p>
<p>Of course, <em>it’s possible to do this directly in the XML</em>, but the struggle is how to manage this in the lead up to publishing - whether spreadsheets, in house systems or elsewhere.  The Aidstream interface would enable this multi-multi recording, but I assume there’s some database behind it - <a class="mention" href="/u/anjesh">@anjesh</a> , do you provide a databse key (or similar) for the above elements?</p>
<p>And - at the other end, if someone wants to convert some XML to a spreadsheet / other format - how do packages then handle such multi-multi relationships, with IDs?</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/herman">@Herman</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/rolfkleef">@rolfkleef</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/pelleaardema">@pelleaardema</a> what’s your experience?</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/sjohns">@SJohns</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/mikesmith">@mikesmith</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/rbesseling">@rbesseling</a>  did this come up in the CSO work on results?</p>

          <title>Vocabulary attribute in Result element version 2.03</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[stolk]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Results</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Currently the standard doesn’t mention the option to add a vocabulary attribute to the RESULT element.<br>
The use of the Result element is relatively new and subject of collective learning. One of our leanings is that a publisher often administrates multiple result frameworks simultaneously. Each framework having different codes and structure.<br>
Combining results and indicators without clarifying the respective vocabulary will create a an undesired degree of chaos.</p>
<p>so the proposal is to allow the attribute vocabulary in Result element</p>

          <title>Challenge: integrating beneficiary feedback data into IATI?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[SJohns]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Results</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I’ve been puzzling on how best IATI data can support iterative/adaptive programme design and shared learning. As IATI project/finance data can be reported in near real-time and we can also easily update objectives and results, there is a potential for it to be useful for this purpose (although some kind of log of changes would be needed to track how a programme is adapted over time). One important part of adaptive design is integration of beneficiary feedback. It also may help support the transparency and participation elements of the Humanitarian Grand Bargain.</p>
<p>Whilst most feedback tends to be tracked at local project level, there is a reported challenge of sharing this learning upwards to inform programme design. See for example the learning from the beneficiary feedback mechanisms pilots in the UK: <a href="http://feedbackmechanisms.org/findings/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://feedbackmechanisms.org/findings/</a> and also thisreport from Development Initiatives:<br>
<a href="http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Beneficiary-feedback-in-donor-programme-design-development-and-evaluation-Uganda-and-Kenya-Report-June-20161.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Beneficiary-feedback-in-donor-programme-design-development-and-evaluation-Uganda-and-Kenya-Report-June-20161.pdf</a> (page 11). Would including a summary of key feedback from beneficiaries in IATI data about the project help to address this challenge?</p>
<p>Would it also support better accountability? In theory, a wider range of constituents would be able to access and use the summary, via websites using IATI data, to check whether the programme/project has been adapted or changed as a result of the feedback.</p>
<p>Would integrating all reporting (project/finance/results/feedback) through one mechanism be more efficient for in-country organisations who are partners with either donor-country based organisations or with donors directly? And would those organisations accept IATI data reporting in lieu of traditional reports?</p>
<p>There are some key considerations in thinking about reporting feedback via IATI. For example, it would have to be done in line with responsible data use standards to protect individuals providing feedback. It may also be used to ‘spin’ media stories where the learning aspect is ignored, and therefore may limit what organisations are willing to disclose.</p>
<p>As it’s qualitative data, perhaps the easiest/quickest way to integrate it is as a new document category, for example a code ‘beneficiary feedback summary’ <a href="http://iatistandard.org/202/codelists/DocumentCategory/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://iatistandard.org/202/codelists/DocumentCategory/</a></p>
<p>However in the longer term, would it be possible/desirable to include it as an additional element, to sit alongside the Results element?</p>
<p>I’d be interested in hearing your views.</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>At the moment, the  field has an attribute aggregation-status: “Boolean flag indicating whether the data in the result set are suitable for aggregation.”</p>
<p>I propose to remove this attribute:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is defined at the  level. There can be multiple  elements in a , and some may be suitable for aggregation, while others are not. Would I then set this flag to “true” (some data in the result set is suitable for aggregation) or to “false” (not all the data is suitable for aggregation)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It doesn’t let me specify over which dimensions it can be aggregated. “Households reached” can usually be aggregated over regions, but not over time spans.</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi, we are seeing a number of organisations who are now either voluntarily or contractually required to use the Results element of the IATI Standard. This element is probably the most under-developed of the IATI Standard, and yet open data on results remains a key aspiration of both IATI (it’s included in the new Vision and Mission) and the Sustainable Development Goals work.</p>
<p>I’d like to set up a discussion on the Results element here (recognising that this has been attempted before) which then feeds into a Results path at the next TAG meeting (in 2016 or early 2017?) to help develop both some consistency in how the element is used, share best practice and solve some problems.</p>
<p>Here’s why:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There are pockets of expertise developing, for example in the Netherlands and amongst development resource providers, and it would be good to bring this together in one place in a very practical way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think we need to develop a common understanding of what the word ‘results’ means, and what IATI results data can and can’t be used for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need to gather and share evidence from Monitoring and Evaluation people within organisations, to check what results they want to record, and how they are want to record them. And also evidence from users that the information that they are getting from the Results element is meaningful and not misleading (ie through the attempted aggregation of apples and pears).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In terms of outputs from this discussion and particularly the TAG, I can see the following would be really useful:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A recommendation to the IATI  technical team on any updates needed to the Results element of the Standard to make it fit for purpose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think it would be good to develop and publish a set of examples - real-world problems and solutions in order to share the knowledge more widely and to ensure much better quality data. So for example, who records what results in a group of organisations working on one project? How do you define attribution? How do you report qualitative results in a way that’s useful to data users?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>What do you think?</p>

          <title>Disaggregation of results</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Kasper]]></dc:creator>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Following the changes in v2.02, I was wondering about the disaggregation of results. In <a href="http://support.iatistandard.org/entries/79499149-Support-disaggregation-of-performance-data" rel="nofollow noopener">this discussion</a>, the addition of dimension and location nodes per target or actual has been introduced and also the idea of allowing more than 1 actual or target node.</p>
<p>However, it seems that allowing more than 1 target/actual node <a href="http://iatistandard.org/202/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/result/indicator/period/target/" rel="nofollow noopener">has not been taken along</a> in the standard. The IATI validator shows an error when using multiple target or actual elements as well.</p>
<p>So I was wondering if it is possible to add this to the discussion of the next version again. And, as a new suggestion, also allow for disaggregation of the indicator’s baseline, similar to the target and actual elements.</p>
<p>Kind regards,<br>
Kasper</p>

            <p>Publishing Results to IATI: Will it Improve Learning and Accountability?</p>
<p>Donors are increasingly making – or considering making – the publication of results information to the IATI standard a requirement of their grantees. But will this lead to increased learning and accountability? What checks would need to be in place to avoid the publication of misleading or useless data, and to ensure that NGOs are supported in their publishing?</p>
<p>This discussion paper – written by Bond’s Michael O’Donnell, explores the background and rationale for publishing results to IATI and the impact this could have on organisations and the transparency of the sector. The paper uses 7 tests to assess the extent to which publishing results to IATI would enhance learning and accountability, and makes recommendations for making the IATI results module fit for purpose, and for donors to consider if making publishing results mandatory.</p>

I agree it is extremely important that aid agencies report their activity results, and that everyone can access these reports through IATI. I am in awe of the analytical grasp that Herb_Caudill has brought to bear on this. But it seems over-ambitious in the forseeable future to think in terms of a way in which indicators can be rigorously defined machine-readably for all activities.

<blockquote>
<p>A lot of the NGOs that we work with want to publish qualitative results. It’s still a use case to be explored, so there are no technical proposals, and so it’s not in 2.02.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Clearly some things (e.g. vaccinations, schoolrooms) are easier to quantify than others (e.g. democracy). That’s not a problem we’re going to solve with XSD.</p>
<p>In the proposed standard:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There are (qualitative) <code>comment</code> elements available at the same level as the (quantitative) <code>actual</code> and <code>target</code> elements. There are narrative <code>description</code> elements available at various levels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disaggregation can be used to represent categorical data like ethnicity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indicator definitions can also provide nuance and context to what’s being measured.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond that, I’m curious to know what more we could envision doing to support qualitative results. Could you perhaps provide some examples of use cases that the proposed standard doesn’t support?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the same time, there are fixes to make the quantitative results more usable, but without a long-term vision of where it should lead to.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Here are some stories that these fixes make possible, none of which is possible with the current standard:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Someone managing a housing reconstruction project in a post-disaster situation can submit the same IATI report to different stakeholders (donors, home office, host country, etc.) instead of spending their time reformatting their data to accommodate mutually incompatible computer systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A researcher exploring whether bednet distribution is effective can query IATI-reported data on bednet delivery, across multiple donors/implementers/countries, and compare that with malaria incidence data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A local investigative journalist can compare IATI-reported results (say, on schoolroom rehabilitation) with facts on the ground, and possibly bring corruption to light.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The administrator of a large bilateral donor agency can answer to her legislature with precision and detail when they ask what was accomplished with taxpayer money.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m not sure what more we could expect from a humble little XML element.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Examples around results are usually for outputs, whereas many NGOs (and donors) want to manage on outcomes and impacts, or different types of theory of change, especially in lobby and advocacy.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The proposed schema is agnostic and can support outcome data just as easily as it can output data. See <a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Codelists/blob/version-2.01/xml/ResultType.xml" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Codelists/blob/version-2.01/xml/ResultType.xml</a> . If you want, you can report not only outputs (e.g. hours of teacher training provided) but outcomes (e.g. improved math scores) and impacts (e.g. greater social mobility). The XSD doesn’t care.</p>
<p>We have to be careful with attribution - does intervention X get all the credit for improvement Y, and is there even a causal relationship at all? That’s what Ph.D. candidates are for. But researchers and evaluators can’t even get started if we are incapable of counting our outputs; in that case they’re left with crude proxies like dollars disbursed, and that’s the least informative metric of all.</p>

          <title>Improving the results element, phase 1: Unambiguous indicator references</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Herb_Caudill]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Results</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I’ve submitted my first stab at the <a href="http://blog.devresults.com/iati-results-standard/#1" rel="nofollow noopener">phase 1 of improving the <code>result</code> element</a>, which is making it possible for indicator results to refer unambiguously to known indicators.</p>
<p>There are two parts to this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Adding a <code>reference</code> element to the <code>indicator</code> element.</strong> <a href="https://github.com/HerbCaudill/IATI-Schemas/blob/results-1/iati-activities-schema.xsd#L1725-L1753" rel="nofollow noopener">(View on Github)</a>. Note that (a) this is <strong>optional</strong>, and (b) you can include multiple references (e.g. if the same indicator is referenced with different codes in different vocabularies).</li>
<li>
<strong>Creating a codelist of Indicator Vocabularies.</strong> <a href="https://github.com/HerbCaudill/IATI-Codelists-NonEmbedded/blob/results-1/xml/IndicatorVocabulary.xml" rel="nofollow noopener">(View on Github)</a>. I’ve started with a few illustrative indicator repositories (US F Framework, World Bank World Development Indicators, UN SDGs, etc). No doubt this list will grow much larger. I’ve added this to the non-embedded codelist repo, because much like the Organisation Registry codelist, additions will likely need to be made on short notice outside of published upgrade schedules.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is backwards-compatible; no existing tests have been broken.</p>
<p>For now I’ve just straight-up forked the IATI repositories and have submitted these changes as pull requests. If it turns out that these changes are controversial or will take months to be approved, I can refactor them into an extension. I’m hoping that won’t be necessary, and at any rate this seemed like the easiest way to make a concrete proposal.</p>
<p>Please let me know what you think.</p>
<p>Cheers<br>
Herb</p>
