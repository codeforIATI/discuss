          <title>ReportAid - a blockchain port of IATI</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Steven_Huckle]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Events</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p><a href="https://github.com/glowkeeper/ReportAid" rel="nofollow noopener">ReportAid</a> is a prototype blockchain-based port of the IATI standard that I developed as part of my PhD at the University of Sussex.</p>
<p>ReportAid is alpha open-source software, but I have a few ideas about how to develop it further, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete the port to the blockchain of the IATA XML.</li>
<li>The app’ currently outputs text. But how about developing a RESTful API that presents the IATI data on the blockchain in XML and/or JSON?</li>
<li>The current interface needs significant improvement and would benefit from the input of a UX Designer</li>
<li>Mobile app’ for querying the data?</li>
</ul>
<p>There will be many other ideas, too - I’d be interested in hearing thoughts!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I have just registered for European Commission’s <span class="hashtag">#EUvsVirus</span> Hackathon, and posted this on their c22-introduce-yourself slack channel:</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Hello everyone - this is a fantastic idea, and I’m pleased to get involved.</em></p>
<p><em>I’m a developer who has just completed a PhD focused on blockchain technologies at the University of Sussex.</em></p>
<p><em>For the Hackathon, I was imagining developing my application ReportAid, which is a blockchain port of the International Aid Transparency Initiative, as it could be a useful tool for documenting humanitarian efforts aimed at fighting COVID-19.</em></p>
<p><em>ReportAid is alpha software. However, I have a few ideas about how to develop it further, and I’d be interested in hearing other ideas, too. If you’re interested in helping develop some ideas for ReportAid during the Hackathon, please reach out.</em></p>
<p><em>And if nothing comes of ReportAid here, I’d be interested in helping out on other initiatives needing software development skills.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>I’d be interested in getting some help to develop the app’ <em>whenever</em>, but would anyone like to join me on the Hackathon to help me to develop some ideas for ReportAid there? I’d like that, very much.</p>
<p>Many thanks.</p>
<p>Dr Steve Huckle</p>

            <p>I just saw that the next <a href="https://conference.cafdo.africa/" rel="nofollow noopener">CAFDO conference</a> will take place in Abidjan Dec 17-19. CAFDO is the Conférence d’Afrique francophone des données ouvertes (Francophone African Open Data Conference); it’s based in Ouagadougou and funded by the <a href="https://www.od4d.net/" rel="nofollow noopener">Open Data for Development</a> program (funded mostly by Canada and Hewlett). Those of you attending the recent Members’ Assembly are aware of some of the awesome work CAFDO is doing in the region.  It should be an interesting event!<br>

            <p>Dear All<br>
Last week we posted information about the TAG Chair election with a fairly short deadline for nominations - the end of this week (November 2nd) to give us time to circulate nominations, and for everybody going to Nepal to think about who they will vote for. Please take a look at the information on the website and send your nomination (or self-nomination) through to me this week.<br>

Thanks very much,<br>

            <p>Maybe I missed a topic, but I was wondering what the process will be for electing a new TAG chair. Some questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How will candidates be selected?</li>
<li>When and how will candidates present themselves (do we have time to reflect a little bit)?</li>
<li>Who will be able to vote?</li>
<li>…</li>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Allowing IATI-data to constitute a resilient, growing web of data and information, we must allow organisational links to be initiated from any point. This means that any IATI-reporting partner should be expected to identify partner-organisations by means of the valid IATI-method (pinpointing legal entities) regardless of any decision on the side of that partner – whether the partner is reporting or not, or using that excact org_id as IATI-identifier or not.</p>
<p>In order for this to happen, and work to our advantage, any IATI-reporting organisation should publish information on any ‘legal entity’ they represent. For each of these legal entities, it must furthermore be registered whether they are IATI-reporting on their own, or forms part of the data published under the overarching organisational entity.</p>
<p>This will allow the data-web to be tied, constructed, from any point of departure, whether or not the partner with the ‘Funding role’ is reporting in IATI-format – or is reporting under another identity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it will allow larger organisations to delegate reporting responsibilities to e.g. ‘country offices’ that are, anyways, responsible for data and data quality-issues, as long as these offices are legal entities, without losing out on the recognition of the unity of the ‘global’ organisation.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, it would also constitute a more robust Master Data Management approach, and allow for easier transitions in the future – compared to the quite cumbersome, current instruction on how to label all elements in the activity-file, in case a reporting org_id is changed.</p>

          <category>IATI TAG 2018</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>We are thinking about the key themes we want to cover at the upcoming TAG2018 in Kathmandu in October/November this year.</p>
<p>I’ve written a <a class="attachment" href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/uploads/default/original/1X/8e06ea28a681766001e43c30ebf2b3a53278254f.pdf">short note</a> with a few ideas but I’d love to hear ideas from the TAG community.</p>
<p>In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>What themes would be particularly relevant to Nepal?</li>
<li>How could we have attendees leaving the TAG with surprise and delight at how IATI can help address their needs?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Please refer to the <a href="https://iatistandard.org/documents/658/IATI_TAG_2018_meeting_proposal.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">new meeting proposal</a> for the annual Technical Advisory Group (TAG) meeting which is being planned for 13-15 November 2018 in Nepal. Please provide your feedback by responding to this Discuss thread.</p>

<p>There’s specific mention of International Aid and Humanitarian Relief in the Impact Track, but IATI should be applicable to other areas</p>
<p>Is anyone considering a proposal?  Perhaps there could be a coordinated community effort…</p>

          <title>Practical IATI use cases for humanitarians: miniTAG in April?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[dpaulus]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Events</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Dear IATI community,<br>
at TU Delft we have a small project on IATI, together with Cordaid, a durch organisation for humanitarian aid and development. We are developing a software prototype that combines IATI data with HDX/HXL data to address information needs of humanitarian field workers. Probably mid/end of April this year, we would like to present our work, why we did it, how we did it and what our results until then are. In a broader sense, the IATI community could use the event to talk about IATI use cases in the humanitarian ‘world’, besides reporting. We thought of organising an IATI miniTAG at TU Delft and would invite interested people to join physically/virtually.</p>
<p>Of course, IATI is first and foremost about transparency and accountability in international development financing. But we specifically wanted to look for an additional use case that would create tangible results for humanitarians in the field. I just wanted to use this forum to sound out the interest within the community. So please let us know here if you would be interested in joining in April <img src="//discuss.iatistandard.org/images/emoji/twitter/slightly_smiling_face.png?v=5" title=":slightly_smiling_face:" class="emoji" alt=":slightly_smiling_face:"></p>
<p>Thanks!<br>
David</p>

            <p>Dear all, we would be delighted if any IATI developer would be interested to use the datasets from the European Commission or Investment Bank in this event. We could assist in discussing ideas if needed.</p>
<p><strong>EU Datathon 2017</strong></p>
<p>Can you re-use open data to promote innovative services? Can you solve other societal challenges using it? Can you create mobile or web apps using open data from different information sources? If yes, <span class="hashtag">#EUdatathon2017</span> is for you!</p>
<p>This first datathon of its kind promotes re-use of <span class="hashtag">#EUopendata</span> from the EU Open Data Portal, the central access point to open data made available by the EU institutions, agencies and bodies.</p>
<p>Data teams will be able to demonstrate how open data from public institutions can be used to address specific policy or societal challenges and promote innovative services, reflecting certain priorities of the Juncker Commission.</p>
<p>Register your team and make a proposal for an app by 8 October. If your idea is preselected, you’ll have 4 weeks until 12 November to develop your idea! Winners will be selected on 16 November during an event in Brussels. Not wanting to hack but simply curious? Just register to attend the event on 16 November.</p>
<p>More information about prizes will follow, but the winning team will have the chance to present their project at the European Big Data Value Forum in Versailles, on 21-23 November 2017, with travel and accommodation expenses paid.</p>
<p>The datathon is being organised by the Estonian Presidency of the Council of the European Union together with the Publications Office of the European Union.</p>
<p>For more information and registration, see the website: <a href="http://publications.europa.eu/eudatathon2017" rel="nofollow noopener">http://publications.europa.eu/eudatathon2017</a></p>

          <title>Possible miniTAG on Traceability - London 28 June</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[JohnAdams]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Events</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>We are considering holding a miniTAG on <strong>Traceability</strong> on the evening of <strong>Wednesday 28 June in London</strong>.</p>
<p>A couple of events are happening at the same time: the OpenAg meeting is taking place 28-30 June and there is a bilaeral meeting planned for 29 June, so it would be good to take the opportunity of some people being in the same place to share some knowledge and recent work on traceability.</p>
<p>We’re thinking of finding a venue near Southwark Cathedral (where the OpenAg event is happening) and making the miniTAG a meetup-style evening. There would be opportunity for Show &amp; Tell and then some follow-up discussion, probably accompanied by some food and drink.</p>
<p>Is anyone interested?</p>
<p>The “miniTAG” branding was an idea that came out of TAG2017 in Tanzania - to encourage small-scale community meetups. This is a bit experimental!</p>

<ul>
<li>As the comment handler is not great in Google Sheets could you restrict comments on the sheet to minor points. Can you address any major issues by replying to this topic.</li>
<li>We have another version of this with a more detailed record of named comments which we thought it would be better to hold back for reference as it makes the proceedings as a whole difficult to follow.</li>
<li>The sheet follows the order of slides used on the day.</li>
<li>Rows are shaded to group multiple slides addressing a single issue.</li>
<li>All issues have been categorised with one of four outcomes: Accept; Reject; Consult further; or None. (Accept/Reject refer, of course, to consensus, and not formal decisions)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Technical Team is meeting next week to plan next steps on consultations for Version 2.03 and issues that need to go to the Members Assembly in June. We will do our best to ensure coherence and continuity in ongoing discussions.</p>

          <title>Renaming &quot;TAG Tech Consult&quot; to &quot;Standards Day&quot;</title>

            <p>I hope this doesn’t cause too much disruption, but …</p>
<p>By labeling day 4 of the TAG as a Technical Consultation we have mistakenly created the impression that Days 2 and 3 are non-technical. The agenda on these days is as varied as the TAG has always been - including technical sessions (of both soft and hard varieties).</p>
<p>The addition of Day 4 was to work at reaching specific consensus on outstanding issues relating to the standard and associated rules and guidelines.</p>
<p>So I hope calling Day 4 “Standards Day” will trip off the tongue and the brain more easily.</p>

          <title>IATI and HXL: panel, mid-level presentation, and/or tech workshop</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Most bottom-up humanitarian activity reports from the field (3Ws: Who, What, Where) arrive in spreadsheet format; many people who want to use IATI data and combine it with other humanitarian data also need to work with tabular formats.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://hxlstandard.org" rel="nofollow noopener">Humanitarian Exchange Language</a> can serve as a bridge in both directions, making it easier to import spreadsheet-type data into the IATI ecosystem, and making it easier to pull IATI data back out for integration into the humanitarian field-data ecosystem.</p>
<p>Possible topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Topic in a policy-level humanitarian-data panel discussion (together with FTS and the Grand Bargain), focusing on bottom-up field reporting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mid-level presentation on existing humanitarian 3Ws, similarities and gaps related to IATI activity reports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evening tech hands-on workshop tagging real 3W spreadsheets and converting them to IATI.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Cheers, David</p>
