            <p>An idea has surfaced to also host a Humanitarian Sprint on the OKFest fringe event.</p>
<p>This could take the shape of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Working with some existing 3W field datasets (OCHA and clusters/NGOs), looking as a group at the lalignments and<br>
misalignments between that and IATI to consider recommendations for both IATI and HXL.</li>
<li>Looking at the draft HXL standards and their alignment with IATI.</li>
<li>Reviewing any existing huimanitarian work going on with FTS.</li>
</ol>
<p>We’ll continue to look into this as an opportunity and gather idea here.</p>

            <p>Whether you’re new to IATI or you have been working with the standard for some time, no doubt you’ll have already started to experience the challenges associated with terminology and understanding of specific terms and phrases commonly used within the standard and by its community.</p>
<p>We would like to spend some focussed collaborative time on helping to get some of these points clarified and documented in an online Gossary resource.</p>
<p>This session is open for all to attend, whether you’ve got specific opinions about terms, or if you’re uncertain about certain areas of the standard, feel free to join in and help build out this glossary to ensure that we can all work within IATI and have the same understanding of what we all mean.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in this session or have any questions or suggestions for the discussion, please post them here.</p>

<p>Particularly working on gathering information from users and developers of open data tools on how to setup and utilise these tools in a variety of environments and use-cases.</p>

            <p>We are planning a TAG side event at the <a href="http://2014.okfestival.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">Open Knowledge Festival</a> in Berlin on Friday 18th July. This will be part of the Open Development side event, held at the Wikimedia building.</p>
<p>We have a couple of topics in mind that would benefit from a group of people gathered in one place:</p>
<ul>
<li>A documentation sprint focussing on building up a good glossary of<br>
IATI terms, ideally in multiple languages.</li>
<li>A ToolCamp, looking at the    range of tools available to generate,<br>
publish, curate and use IATI    data, feeding into the excellent Open<br>
Development Toolkit.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are also looking for ideas from the TAG members for anything else that we could usefully achieve together. Please add your ideas below.</p>
