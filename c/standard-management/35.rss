            <p>The following addition to the IATI Organisation Identifier list has been proposed for The King Hussein Foundation (KHF).</p>
<p>The organisation was established in Jordan, 1999 to serve as an enduring commitment to His Majesty King Hussein’s humanitarian vision and legacy. Due to this special circumstance, they are not registered via a recognised <a href="http://org-id.guide/results?structure=all&amp;coverage=JO&amp;sector=all">registration agency</a> and using tax codes are not sufficient. The XI-IATI identifier has been pursued.</p>
<p><strong>Code:</strong>  XI-IATI-KHF</p>
<p><strong>Name:</strong>  The King Hussein Foundation (KHF)</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong>  Their mission is to build upon King Hussein’s lifelong commitment to peace, sustainable community development and cross-cultural understanding through national and regional programs that promote education and leadership, economic empowerment and participatory decision-making.</p>

          <dc:creator><![CDATA[IATI-techteam]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Non-Core Codelist Amendments</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The following addition to the <a href="http://iatistandard.org/203/codelists/IATIOrganisationIdentifier/">IATI Organisation identifier </a>list has been proposed for the World Bank Trust Funds.<br>
<strong>Code:</strong> XI-IATI-WBTF</p>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> World Bank Trust Funds (WBTF)</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> A trust fund (TF) is a financing arrangement established with contributions from one or more external development partner(s)/partners, and in some cases, from the World Bank Group, to support development-related activities. The World Bank acts as a trustee/administrator for development partners (donors) funds and implements the activities financed through trust funds in accordance with the signed agreements with donors. As part of fiduciary obligations, the World Bank as Trustee/administrator of trust funds maintains the records for trust funds activities distinct and separate from the activities of IBRD and IDA. The Bank also provides periodic report on the financial situation and results of the individual trust funds to donors.</p>
<p><strong>URL:</strong> <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/trust-fund-annual-report-2019">https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/trust-fund-annual-report-2019</a></p>
<p>The IATI tech team has been working closely with the WBTF in preparing their data for publication.  The unique nature of financing by the World Bank Trust Funds have specific reporting attributes that may not necessarily be the same as for IBRD/IDA projects. Larger Trust Funds in the portfolio often have specific external reviews, which needs to be managed closer with the requestors of the review. There are also different systems used by WBTF and WB.<br>
There is no registration agency or separate identifier for such entities as the WBTF and therefore the XI-IATI route has been taken. Creating a separate  XI-IATI identifier for the World Bank Trust Funds (World Bank TF) will allows publishing the trust fund data in IATI separate from <a href="https://www.iatiregistry.org/publisher/worldbank">the World Bank.</a></p>
<p>If no objection is received this XI-IATI code will be approved and added in a week.</p>

            <p>To be clear about the current process for creating Org IDs: the  Tech Team requests an ‘XI-IATI’ Org ID when there is no existing <a href="http://org-id.guide/">org-id.guide</a> identifier that is suitable for their organisation; and the Org ID team cannot identify a new identifier that may be available to create for that organisation.</p>
<p>Currently, we simply request for <code>XI-IATI</code> + <code>a short acronym or abbreviation for the organisation</code> (i.e. <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/added-new-organisation-identifier-xi-iati-attic/1655">XI-IATI-ATTIC</a>) is used and added to the list of <a href="http://reference.iatistandard.org/203/codelists/IATIOrganisationIdentifier/">IATI-maintained Org IDs</a>.</p>
<p>In a recent XI-IATI Org ID request <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/new-organisation-identifier-xi-iati-esfd/1898">post</a>, it has been suggested that a country code (and perhaps an org-type code as well) could be added to XI-IATI Org IDs, to more easily identify the identity of the organisation. e.g. XI-IATI-ATTIC-TD (as Attic is based in Chad).</p>
<p>Further conversations have also been had in this regard previously:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>We have created this post so that this can be discussed further while not inhibiting the publishing process for a particular organisation.</p>

            <p>While poking around the IATI Query Builder I noticed that the Organisation Role codelist does not contain “reporting”.</p>
<p>Would it not make sense for this role to be coded like the other ones (ie funding, implementing, etc), enabling searches through the datastore? Does anyone remember why it was not included in the codelist from the beginning?</p>
<p>Note that “Type of organisation” is already an attribute of the “reporting organisation” element.</p>
<p>Organisation Role is a core codelist. Not sure if this would be a minor or major upgrade. <a href="http://reference.iatistandard.org/201/codelists/OrganisationRole/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://reference.iatistandard.org/201/codelists/OrganisationRole/</a></p>

            <p>The new [SDG guidance] <img src="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11vsqHc-mdAYUCqrrGCaCTFxu48oD3VvBVSlY9Q3ideo/edit" rel="nofollow noopener">https://docs.google.com/document/d/11vsqHc-mdAYUCqrrGCaCTFxu48oD3VvBVSlY9Q3ideo/edit</a>) states that: “IATI recommends that if a publisher’s internal indicators do not directly match any SDG Indicator, they should choose one SDG Indicator that their internal result’s indicator best relates or contributes to.”</p>
<p>I think this breaks how IATI works and am very surprised that this is allowed as this means that data users cannot rely on the data being supplied by a publisher, exactly matching the codelist entry that it is marked as.</p>
<p>This means that if a user were to aggregate all the baselines for a particular SDG indicator, they would not know that in some cases, the baseline data provided, is actually for a different indicator, not the one they are expecting, and therefore their conclusions from using this data would be false.</p>
<p>IATI needs to find a way to use existing tools e.g. the <code>&lt;legacy-data&gt;</code> element, or a new element, to allow publishers to indicate whether the data they are supplying is from a similar, but not exactly the same indicator/sector etc to that described by the codelist which they have used to mark it. This could easily done by an attribute i.e. <code>match=not_exact</code> or similar.</p>

            <p>Currently the guidance is that “f the activity has only one sector, then it is presumed that 100% of the funding is going to that sector”.</p>
<p>This (as with all of the ‘assumption’ based rules) makes it harder for data users. The ‘assumption’ of 100% could be replaced by a rule that requires a percentage value to be given for all sectors added, and therefore that this should be 100% where only one sector is provided.</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Currently the guidance states “Recipient country budgets can be published in the currency of the country. However, budget values <strong>should</strong> not be repeated in multiple currencies.”</p>
<p>I am proposing that this ‘should’ should be made a ‘must’ (and a rule added) to make data use easier as publishing the same budget in multiple currencies would make it very hard to use the data as there is no way to know if they are duplicates or not?</p>
<p>Or is there a way to know if two budget items are identical, just in different currencies? Or should we introduce a ‘budget element ID’ so publishers could signal that this is the same budget? Or are users expected to deduce from the period of the budget that they are the same?</p>
<p>I also wonder why ‘budgets’ don’t use the transaction element like all the other financial flows? The transaction element has more of the tools needed to solve this issue I think.</p>

            <p>The guidance for the standard recommends using DAC codelists in several places - this is not in keeping with the ambition to be a global aid data standard, and can result in worse quality data e.g. the DAC5 sector codelist has limited information in the 7xxxx humanitarian codes compared to the humanitarian cluster codes.</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>In several places, where a codelist is not specified, then the DAC codelist is assumed. This is unhelpful for data users who have to maintain knowledge of all the assumptions they need to make, rather than relying on the information embodied within the data/standard. Adding the codelist reference should be very little effort for publishers.</p>

            <p>In order to ‘standardise the standard’ we should remove all the areas where when a codelist is not specified (e.g. sector vocabulary), then one of the codelists is set as the default (although not in any way a machine could follow). This would make the standard less complex e.g. easier for users who would not need to maintain their own lists of where these rules apply. These typically also reinforce the idea of IATI as a DAC centric institution which is not helpful.</p>
<p>A very second best solution would be a way for IATI data consuming systems to track these ‘defaults’.</p>

            <p>In Copenhagen 2019, Ghana explained that in order to use IATI transaction (or other) data in their systems they needed harder evidence e.g. an official document supporting the data. Therefore it would be useful to be able to link e.g. a transaction to a specific document which forms the underlying evidence.</p>
<p>Multiple IATI elements could be linked to the same document e.g. the activity title, budget etc could all be linked to the project document. Many transactions could be linked to a single transactions statement, but this would save a lot of time searching though the documents associated with a project to try and find the right one. Publishers could also link to the relevant part of their own websites as evidence for some IATI data.</p>

          <title>[Added] Proposal to add ‘Cash Transfer’ and ‘Voucher’ codelist under Aid Type Vocabulary</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[petyakangalova]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Non-Core Codelist Amendments</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <h2>PROPOSAL</h2>
<p>During IATI 2.03 version upgrade, a change was made to allow <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/add-vocabularies-to-aid-type-included-2-03/847">different aid-type vocabularies</a>. Previous conversations on reporting cash and voucher took place on <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/enable-reporting-of-payment-via-in-kind-vouchers-or-cash-transfers/664/21"> IATI Discuss</a> suggesting that once an agreement has been reached via the CaLP group, a proposal for a non-core codelist can be made. A summary of agreements and recommendations has now been provided by the Tracking Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA) Working Group (see Background and Summary of Agreements and Recommendations sections below for more details). As a result, we propose the following addition:</p>
<p>New<a href="http://reference.iatistandard.org/203/codelists/AidTypeVocabulary" rel="nofollow noopener"> Aid Type vocabulary</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Code</strong>: 4</li>
<li>
<strong>Name:</strong> Cash and Voucher Modalities</li>
<li>
<strong>URL:</strong> Link to <a href="http://reference.iatistandard.org/codelists/AidType/CashandVoucherModalities" rel="nofollow noopener">http://reference.iatistandard.org/codelists/AidType/CashandVoucherModalities</a> once below codes have been added</li>
</ul>
<p>The associated Cash and Voucher Modalities codelist (following definitions from the <a href="http://www.cashlearning.org/resources/glossary" rel="nofollow noopener">CaLP Glossary</a>).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Code</strong>: 1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Name</strong>: Cash Transfer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The provision of assistance in the form of money - either physical currency or e-cash - to recipients (individuals, households or communities). Cash transfers are by definition unrestricted in terms of use and distinct from restricted modalities including vouchers and in-kind assistance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Code:</strong> 2</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Voucher</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: A paper, token or e-voucher that can be exchanged for a set quantity or value of goods or services, denominated either as a cash value (e.g. $15) or predetermined commodities (e.g. 5 kg maize) or specific services (e.g. milling of 5 kg of maize), or a combination of value and commodities. Vouchers are restricted by default, although the degree of restriction will vary based on the programme design and type of voucher. They are redeemable with preselected vendors or in ‘fairs’ created by the implementing agency. The terms vouchers, stamps, or coupons might be used interchangeably.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a proposal for <strong>addition to the <a href="http://reference.iatistandard.org/203/codelists/AidTypeVocabulary" rel="nofollow noopener">AidType Vocabulary codelist</a></strong> which is a non-core codelist. Please add any comments by responding to this post by <strong>Thursday 1st of August 2019</strong>. It will be helpful to also hear whether within your organizations, it common (or not) for you to implement (or fund) single projects which have both cash and voucher components. Currently you can disaggregate that at transaction level. We have allowed two weeks given the summer period. Following response from the community the new AidType Vocabulary codes will be added within a week.</p>
<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
<p>The agreements/recommendations* below comprise the key outputs of the work undertaken through the Tracking Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA) Working Group from 2017 to 2019. The Tracking CVA Working Group was established as the platform for engagement and decision-making for the sub-workstream on Tracking CVA, which is part of the Grand Bargain Cash Workstream. The Tracking CVA sub-workstream has been co-lead by the Cash Learning Partnership (CaLP) and the European Commission Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (DG ECHO), and includes donors, NGOs, UN agencies and data specialists among its members.</p>
<p>The primary objective of this work has been to help facilitate more systematic and standardized tracking of the volume of CVA, prompted in large part by commitments to increase the scale of cash assistance, for example under the Grand Bargain. The main focus to date has been on identifying workable minimum requirements to be applied to tracking programme data at the global interagency level (with FTS and IATI identified as the critical mechanisms through which this might be captured). This is because a key aim driving the process has been to be able to calculate overall levels of humanitarian assistance delivered as cash and/or vouchers.</p>
<p>For readers interested in finding out more about the process and discussions which have generated the agreements and recommendations, please consult the Tracking CVA workshop reports from<a href="http://www.cashlearning.org/downloads/measuring-ctp-workshoprome-2018final-report-for-consultationaugust-2018.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener"> Rome (June 2018)</a> and<a href="http://www.cashlearning.org/downloads/london-tracking-cash--vouchers-workshopsummary-reportfinal-feb-2019.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener"> London (October 2018)</a>, along with the CaLP-commissioned<a href="http://www.cashlearning.org/downloads/measuring-cash-scoping-study-reportfinal-1.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener"> scoping study</a> on this topic. These reports also include the attendee lists from the two workshops, comprising over 45 individuals from over 30 organizations in total, along with key informants to the scoping study.</p>
<h2>SUMMARY OF AGREEMENTS &amp; RECOMMENDATIONS</h2>
<p><strong>Disaggregation of Modalities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>AGREEMENT: Cash and vouchers should be disaggregated in tracking humanitarian aid at the global interagency level as a minimum requirement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AGREEMENT: There is no need to track restriction as a separate category at the global interagency level. All cash transfers are unrestricted, and all vouchers are restricted. ‘Cash’ and 'vouchers’ is the preferred terminology on the grounds of clarity and widespread usage, reflected in the CaLP Glossary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RECOMMENDATION: Reporting on all humanitarian assistance should be disaggregated by modality e.g. in-kind, cash, vouchers, service delivery. The aim would be to establish these as minimum tracking requirements at the global interagency level</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conditionality</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>AGREEMENT: Conditionality should not be tracked at the global interagency level. Tracking conditionality at this level is of limited value as meaningful analysis would require further programming detail on the type of conditionality. This does not preclude the inclusion of conditionality as a data category at other levels of reporting, but it is not a minimum requirement</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tracking Values and Costs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>AGREEMENT: The value of transfers made to recipients should be used as the primary basis (minimum requirement) for tracking cash and vouchers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RECOMMENDATION: In the medium-term track both the value of transfers plus associated programming costs</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reporting by Objective (Sectoral and Cross-sectoral)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>AGREEMENT: Reporting on all humanitarian assistance should include the objective (e.g. shelter, food security, cross-sectoral category)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AGREEMENT: A separate cross-sectoral reporting category is needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RECOMMENDATION: Use ‘multipurpose’ as the cross-sectoral reporting category, and test this in practice</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the agreements summarized above, it is possible to identify a group of current minimum requirements for tracking cash and voucher assistance. Given the unresolved issues relating to the points classified as recommendations, these are not generally captured in the minimum requirements at this stage (although they might be in future, pending associated developments, learning and agreements).</p>
