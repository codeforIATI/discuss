            <p>The following addition to the IATI Organisation Identifier list has been proposed for The King Hussein Foundation (KHF).</p>
<p>The organisation was established in Jordan, 1999 to serve as an enduring commitment to His Majesty King Hussein’s humanitarian vision and legacy. Due to this special circumstance, they are not registered via a recognised <a href="http://org-id.guide/results?structure=all&amp;coverage=JO&amp;sector=all">registration agency</a> and using tax codes are not sufficient. The XI-IATI identifier has been pursued.</p>
<p><strong>Code:</strong>  XI-IATI-KHF</p>
<p><strong>Name:</strong>  The King Hussein Foundation (KHF)</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong>  Their mission is to build upon King Hussein’s lifelong commitment to peace, sustainable community development and cross-cultural understanding through national and regional programs that promote education and leadership, economic empowerment and participatory decision-making.</p>

          <dc:creator><![CDATA[IATI-techteam]]></dc:creator>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The following addition to the <a href="http://iatistandard.org/203/codelists/IATIOrganisationIdentifier/">IATI Organisation identifier </a>list has been proposed for the World Bank Trust Funds.<br>
<strong>Code:</strong> XI-IATI-WBTF</p>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> World Bank Trust Funds (WBTF)</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> A trust fund (TF) is a financing arrangement established with contributions from one or more external development partner(s)/partners, and in some cases, from the World Bank Group, to support development-related activities. The World Bank acts as a trustee/administrator for development partners (donors) funds and implements the activities financed through trust funds in accordance with the signed agreements with donors. As part of fiduciary obligations, the World Bank as Trustee/administrator of trust funds maintains the records for trust funds activities distinct and separate from the activities of IBRD and IDA. The Bank also provides periodic report on the financial situation and results of the individual trust funds to donors.</p>
<p><strong>URL:</strong> <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/trust-fund-annual-report-2019">https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/trust-fund-annual-report-2019</a></p>
<p>The IATI tech team has been working closely with the WBTF in preparing their data for publication.  The unique nature of financing by the World Bank Trust Funds have specific reporting attributes that may not necessarily be the same as for IBRD/IDA projects. Larger Trust Funds in the portfolio often have specific external reviews, which needs to be managed closer with the requestors of the review. There are also different systems used by WBTF and WB.<br>
There is no registration agency or separate identifier for such entities as the WBTF and therefore the XI-IATI route has been taken. Creating a separate  XI-IATI identifier for the World Bank Trust Funds (World Bank TF) will allows publishing the trust fund data in IATI separate from <a href="https://www.iatiregistry.org/publisher/worldbank">the World Bank.</a></p>
<p>If no objection is received this XI-IATI code will be approved and added in a week.</p>

            <p>To be clear about the current process for creating Org IDs: the  Tech Team requests an ‘XI-IATI’ Org ID when there is no existing <a href="http://org-id.guide/">org-id.guide</a> identifier that is suitable for their organisation; and the Org ID team cannot identify a new identifier that may be available to create for that organisation.</p>
<p>Currently, we simply request for <code>XI-IATI</code> + <code>a short acronym or abbreviation for the organisation</code> (i.e. <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/added-new-organisation-identifier-xi-iati-attic/1655">XI-IATI-ATTIC</a>) is used and added to the list of <a href="http://reference.iatistandard.org/203/codelists/IATIOrganisationIdentifier/">IATI-maintained Org IDs</a>.</p>
<p>In a recent XI-IATI Org ID request <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/new-organisation-identifier-xi-iati-esfd/1898">post</a>, it has been suggested that a country code (and perhaps an org-type code as well) could be added to XI-IATI Org IDs, to more easily identify the identity of the organisation. e.g. XI-IATI-ATTIC-TD (as Attic is based in Chad).</p>
<p>Further conversations have also been had in this regard previously:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/added-change-the-guidance-on-xi-iati-organisation-identifiers/604" class="inline-onebox">[Added] Change the guidance on XI-IATI- organisation identifiers</a></li>

</ul>
<p>We have created this post so that this can be discussed further while not inhibiting the publishing process for a particular organisation.</p>

          <title>[Added] Proposal to add ‘Cash Transfer’ and ‘Voucher’ codelist under Aid Type Vocabulary</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[petyakangalova]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Non-Core Codelist Amendments</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <h2>PROPOSAL</h2>
<p>During IATI 2.03 version upgrade, a change was made to allow <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/add-vocabularies-to-aid-type-included-2-03/847">different aid-type vocabularies</a>. Previous conversations on reporting cash and voucher took place on <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/enable-reporting-of-payment-via-in-kind-vouchers-or-cash-transfers/664/21"> IATI Discuss</a> suggesting that once an agreement has been reached via the CaLP group, a proposal for a non-core codelist can be made. A summary of agreements and recommendations has now been provided by the Tracking Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA) Working Group (see Background and Summary of Agreements and Recommendations sections below for more details). As a result, we propose the following addition:</p>
<p>New<a href="http://reference.iatistandard.org/203/codelists/AidTypeVocabulary" rel="nofollow noopener"> Aid Type vocabulary</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Code</strong>: 4</li>
<li>
<strong>Name:</strong> Cash and Voucher Modalities</li>
<li>
<strong>URL:</strong> Link to <a href="http://reference.iatistandard.org/codelists/AidType/CashandVoucherModalities" rel="nofollow noopener">http://reference.iatistandard.org/codelists/AidType/CashandVoucherModalities</a> once below codes have been added</li>
</ul>
<p>The associated Cash and Voucher Modalities codelist (following definitions from the <a href="http://www.cashlearning.org/resources/glossary" rel="nofollow noopener">CaLP Glossary</a>).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Code</strong>: 1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Name</strong>: Cash Transfer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The provision of assistance in the form of money - either physical currency or e-cash - to recipients (individuals, households or communities). Cash transfers are by definition unrestricted in terms of use and distinct from restricted modalities including vouchers and in-kind assistance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Code:</strong> 2</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Voucher</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: A paper, token or e-voucher that can be exchanged for a set quantity or value of goods or services, denominated either as a cash value (e.g. $15) or predetermined commodities (e.g. 5 kg maize) or specific services (e.g. milling of 5 kg of maize), or a combination of value and commodities. Vouchers are restricted by default, although the degree of restriction will vary based on the programme design and type of voucher. They are redeemable with preselected vendors or in ‘fairs’ created by the implementing agency. The terms vouchers, stamps, or coupons might be used interchangeably.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a proposal for <strong>addition to the <a href="http://reference.iatistandard.org/203/codelists/AidTypeVocabulary" rel="nofollow noopener">AidType Vocabulary codelist</a></strong> which is a non-core codelist. Please add any comments by responding to this post by <strong>Thursday 1st of August 2019</strong>. It will be helpful to also hear whether within your organizations, it common (or not) for you to implement (or fund) single projects which have both cash and voucher components. Currently you can disaggregate that at transaction level. We have allowed two weeks given the summer period. Following response from the community the new AidType Vocabulary codes will be added within a week.</p>
<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
<p>The agreements/recommendations* below comprise the key outputs of the work undertaken through the Tracking Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA) Working Group from 2017 to 2019. The Tracking CVA Working Group was established as the platform for engagement and decision-making for the sub-workstream on Tracking CVA, which is part of the Grand Bargain Cash Workstream. The Tracking CVA sub-workstream has been co-lead by the Cash Learning Partnership (CaLP) and the European Commission Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (DG ECHO), and includes donors, NGOs, UN agencies and data specialists among its members.</p>
<p>The primary objective of this work has been to help facilitate more systematic and standardized tracking of the volume of CVA, prompted in large part by commitments to increase the scale of cash assistance, for example under the Grand Bargain. The main focus to date has been on identifying workable minimum requirements to be applied to tracking programme data at the global interagency level (with FTS and IATI identified as the critical mechanisms through which this might be captured). This is because a key aim driving the process has been to be able to calculate overall levels of humanitarian assistance delivered as cash and/or vouchers.</p>
<p>For readers interested in finding out more about the process and discussions which have generated the agreements and recommendations, please consult the Tracking CVA workshop reports from<a href="http://www.cashlearning.org/downloads/measuring-ctp-workshoprome-2018final-report-for-consultationaugust-2018.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener"> Rome (June 2018)</a> and<a href="http://www.cashlearning.org/downloads/london-tracking-cash--vouchers-workshopsummary-reportfinal-feb-2019.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener"> London (October 2018)</a>, along with the CaLP-commissioned<a href="http://www.cashlearning.org/downloads/measuring-cash-scoping-study-reportfinal-1.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener"> scoping study</a> on this topic. These reports also include the attendee lists from the two workshops, comprising over 45 individuals from over 30 organizations in total, along with key informants to the scoping study.</p>
<h2>SUMMARY OF AGREEMENTS &amp; RECOMMENDATIONS</h2>
<p><strong>Disaggregation of Modalities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>AGREEMENT: Cash and vouchers should be disaggregated in tracking humanitarian aid at the global interagency level as a minimum requirement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AGREEMENT: There is no need to track restriction as a separate category at the global interagency level. All cash transfers are unrestricted, and all vouchers are restricted. ‘Cash’ and 'vouchers’ is the preferred terminology on the grounds of clarity and widespread usage, reflected in the CaLP Glossary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RECOMMENDATION: Reporting on all humanitarian assistance should be disaggregated by modality e.g. in-kind, cash, vouchers, service delivery. The aim would be to establish these as minimum tracking requirements at the global interagency level</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conditionality</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>AGREEMENT: Conditionality should not be tracked at the global interagency level. Tracking conditionality at this level is of limited value as meaningful analysis would require further programming detail on the type of conditionality. This does not preclude the inclusion of conditionality as a data category at other levels of reporting, but it is not a minimum requirement</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tracking Values and Costs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>AGREEMENT: The value of transfers made to recipients should be used as the primary basis (minimum requirement) for tracking cash and vouchers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RECOMMENDATION: In the medium-term track both the value of transfers plus associated programming costs</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reporting by Objective (Sectoral and Cross-sectoral)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>AGREEMENT: Reporting on all humanitarian assistance should include the objective (e.g. shelter, food security, cross-sectoral category)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AGREEMENT: A separate cross-sectoral reporting category is needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RECOMMENDATION: Use ‘multipurpose’ as the cross-sectoral reporting category, and test this in practice</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the agreements summarized above, it is possible to identify a group of current minimum requirements for tracking cash and voucher assistance. Given the unresolved issues relating to the points classified as recommendations, these are not generally captured in the minimum requirements at this stage (although they might be in future, pending associated developments, learning and agreements).</p>

            <p>At version 2.03 new organisation types were added to the <a href="http://reference.iatistandard.org/203/codelists/OrganisationType/" rel="nofollow noopener">OrganisationType</a> codelist.</p>
<p>One of these was: <strong>24 - Partner Country based NGO</strong></p>
<p>As part of the change descriptions for each org type were created but only added for the new codes. However, code 24 accidentally got the wrong description according to the <a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Codelists-NonEmbedded/issues/182" rel="nofollow noopener">Mapping Spreadsheet</a> as seen on the github issue.</p>
<p>It should read:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>National NGO / CSOs only in partner countries</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Rather than the International NGO description:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>NGOs not based in an aid recipient country and carrying out operations in one or more aid recipient countries.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>This also brings up the need for agreement on the descriptions for all organisation types. This conversation is to be had in preparation for the next upgrade (tbd).</p>
<p>If there are no objections within 7 days, the tech team will implement the <a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Codelists-NonEmbedded/pull/297" rel="nofollow noopener">bug fix</a> to correct the description of OrgType code 24 to: <em>National NGO / CSOs only in partner countries</em></p>

          <title>Sector Code List - Addition (proposal)</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Michelle_IOM]]></dc:creator>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Forgive my ignorance but can someone enlighten me on how a vocabulary could be added to a code list?</p>
<p>In particular I’m wondering what it would take to add the UN CEB categories as a sector codelist.  Currently there are 5 categories which can be found at <a href="http://www.unsceb.org/content/FS-F00-04" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.unsceb.org/content/FS-F00-04</a>.  There are on-going discussions to alter them but when they are finalized I’m thinking it may be a desirable list to be able to code against.</p>
<p>While this would only be relevant for UN agencies, there are quite a few of us out there.  And I do see other code lists which appear to be targeted (3 Europe &amp; 4-US) so I don’t know that it would be out of line to have this as a vocabulary option.</p>
<p>Feedback on process is much appreciated.</p>

            <p>I may be mistaken but didn’t there used to be links within the standard that pointed us to the exact vocabulary lists used for regions.  I see that code 1 is the OECD DAC and 2 is the UN but I’m not seeing links to those two documents.  I thought there used to be links.  Did this change or am I mistaken?</p>
<p>For what its worth, having links to the actual lists is helpful for new users to ensure one gets to exactly what the standard is looking for.</p>
