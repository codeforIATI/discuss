**Schema Object**
None
</p><p>
**Type of Change**
Addition of guidance
</p><p>
**Issue**
Publishers and users require clearer guidance on how to avoid double counting when adding up financials.
</p><p>
**Proposal**
Add a section on double counting to the standard guidance on [Establishing Publishing Policies](http://iatistandard.org/202/guidance/how-to-publish/establish-publishing-policies/). 
</p><p>
**Standards Day**
As double counting cannot be avoided in the IATI standard, the proposals for better guidance on the topic was welcomed by everyone. Following explanation of what is considered as double counting in IATI terms, it was suggested that the definition of double counting is made clearer and that the guidance is closely linked with hierarchy and traceability guidelines.

Aggregation status: include option for cummulative results</p>

iati-activities/iati-activity/result/indicator/aggregation-status</p>
<p><strong>Type of Change</strong><br>
Addition to Schema</p>
<p><strong>Issue</strong><br>
Currently, there is (to my knowledge) no option to indicate whether an indicator is a stock or a flow. We report several cummulative indicators (results are reported cummulative over time for one activity), however we learned that this may cause problems in the aggregation over time (since the results are reported on annual basis and a project can last several years).</p>
<p><strong>Proposal</strong><br>
The issue could be solved in 2 ways: either by adding another option to the indicator measure (1) or by including options in the aggregation status (2).</p>
<p>(1) Indicator measure ‘unit’ is very general. We suggest to distinguish if the result/unit is reported cummulative over time (cummulative result from baseline until the reported result period for that activity) or not (only the result/progress in that result period)</p>
<p>(2) Alternatively, the aggregation status could be more specific to indicate on which dimension can be aggregated, e.g. over time (=result period) or activities.</p>

          <title>Exchange Rate Options (excluded 2.03)</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[bill_anderson]]></dc:creator>

<p>The standard currently does not accommodate the reporting of specific exchange rates that might be tied to a transaction. Rather, a <code>value-date</code> allows for users to convert the reported value into any currency using standard historical lookup tables (maintained inter alia by the IMF and OECD). There are, however, legal and operational use cases where the explicit reporting of a specific exchange rate may be necessary.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/issues/384">Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS) has also been exploring this issue</a> and is considering two options which translate in IATI terms to:</p>
<p><strong>Option One</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>transaction/value/<span class="mention">@alt-currency</span> -  the secondary currency</li>
<li>transaction/value/<span class="mention">@alt-value</span> - the value in <code>alt-currency</code>
</li>
<li>transaction/value/<span class="mention">@exchange-rate</span> - conversion between <code>value</code> and <code>alt-value</code> on <code>@value-date</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Option Two</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>transaction/value/exchange-rate/<span class="mention">@currency</span> - the secondary currency</li>
<li>transaction/value/exchange-rate/<span class="mention">@rate</span> - the exchange rate from <code>transaction/value/@currency</code> to secondary currency on <code>transaction/value/@value-date</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We could EITHER adopt one of these options OR we could postpone this proposal and engage in the OCDS discussion to adopt a common approach between the standards.</p>

<p><strong>Type of Change</strong><br>
Addition to Schema</p>
<p><strong>Issue</strong><br>
Knowing what application has been used to generate IATI data is of use for two reasons. Firstly it allows users and publishers to track similarities in data quality issues across publishers. For example a problem that arises in the data of one publisher may well be replicated across all publishers using the same system. Secondly it will allow new publishers to find others who have already generated IATI data from a similar system.</p>
<p><strong>Proposal</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Add attributes iati-activities/@publisher-app and iati-organisations/@publisher-app
<ul>
<li>Definition
A code describing the application used to publish this file. It must be a valid value in the PublisherApp codelist.
</li>
<li>Occurs

Agreement that the information would be useful, though more research needs to be undertaken. Is also metadata, so may want to sit in the Registry rather than in the standard.</p>

          <title>Adding links to related OCDS contracts (excluded 2.03)</title>

<p><strong>Type of Change</strong><br>
Addition</p>
<p><strong>Issue</strong><br>
Contracts published using the Open Contracting Data Standard can be linked to activities published through IATI, at either activity or transaction level.</p>
<p><strong>Proposal</strong></p>
<p>Based on advice from <a class="mention" href="/u/timdavies">@TimDavies</a> …</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>related-contract/<span class="mention">@contract-process-id</span></strong><br>
Contracting process identifier - in OCDS this is the ocid (Open Contracting ID) and should be a globally unique identifier</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>related-contract/<span class="mention">@contract-id</span></strong><br>
Contract Identifier - a contracting process might result in multiple contracts (for example, a call for partners that then awards 5 partners, each with their own contract). The Contract ID only has to be unique within the scope of the contracting process, so to unique identify a specific contract requires the pairing of these identifiers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>related-contract/<span class="mention">@url</span></strong><br>
A URL could be provided to a OCDS release package that contains the contracting process and contract discussed. However, OCDS does not use URLs as identifiers, and recognises that (a) some publishers provide multiple processes at a particular URI (e.g. when they only publish bulk data). and (b) some publishers struggle to maintain stable URIs - so we tend to think of URIs as helpful for users, but no guarantee of discovering information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Standards Day</strong><br>
This was discussed in a TAG session on contracting but was mistakenly overlooked on the Standards Day agenda</p>

<p><strong>Standard</strong><br>
Activity</p>
<p>
**Schema Object**
None
</p><p>
**Type of Change**
Addition of guidance
</p><p>
**Issue**
Publishers and users require clearer guidance on how funds can be traced down the delivery chain.
</p><p>
**Proposal**
Add a section on traceability to the standard guidance on [Establishing Publishing Policies](http://iatistandard.org/202/guidance/how-to-publish/establish-publishing-policies/). This should include:
</p><ul>
<li>Incoming funds and commitments transactions should contain provider-activity-id where the funds are received from an IATI reporting institution.
</li>
<li>Transaction types ‘Disbursement’ and ‘Expenditure’ should be used in accordance with the descriptions in the Transaction Type codelist. i.e. Disbursements are made to recipients who will be expected to report their activities to IATI. The recipients of expenditures fall outside of IATI traceability standards.
</li>
<li>Incoming funds and commitments transactions should contain provider-org details where the funds are received from a non-IATI reporting institution.
</li>
<li>Disbursement transactions should contain receiver-org details where the funds are to be received from a non-IATI reporting institution.
</li>
</ul>
**Standards Day**
Proposals were accepted. Plus:
<ul>
<li>While not specifically related to this proposal, question was raised about the possibility of adding incoming commitments.
</li>
<li>It was pointed put that the definition of disbursement and expenditure can be better explained.
</li>
<li>It was suggested that for better data use, provider org should provide full name and more elaborate description. It was also proposed that a common term is used for organisations that are legitimately unable to disclose this information.
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Standard</strong><br>
Activity</p>
<p>
**Schema Object**
iati-activity/participating-org/@role
</p><p>
**Type of Change**
Addition to Embedded codelist
</p><p>
**Issue**
Publishers are responsible for reporting on their ‘own’ activities, but may also act as an official proxy for another organisation or, as a secondary publisher, report on a third party’s activities. In the  latter two cases it is not always evident to the user which of the reported participating organisations - funders and/or implementers - actually ‘owns’ the reported activity and provided the information. An additional OrganisationRole code would help clarify this.
</p><p>
**Proposal**
* Add code: 5 - Responsible
</p><p>The organisation responsible for the reported account and transactions of an activity as recorded by a proxy or secondary publisher.</p>
<p>
**Standards Day**
There was confusion about what is meant by the term 'secondary publisher'. The use of the term 'proxy' was suggested to clarify where publishers report 'officially' on behalf of another organisation. (eg Swedish SIDA and Ministry of Foreign Affairs). Further consultation was requested.

          <title>Hierarchies - general guidance</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[IATI-techteam]]></dc:creator>
          <category>2.03 Decimal Upgrade Proposals</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>This proposal is part of the <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/version-2-03-decimal-upgrade-index-of-proposals/838">2.03 upgrade process</a>, please comment by replying below.</p>
<p><strong>Standard</strong><br>
Activity</p>
<p>
**Schema Object**
None
</p><p>
**Type of Change**
Addition of guidance
</p><p>
**Issue**
Publishers and users require clearer guidance on how hierarchical business models are managed.
</p><p>
**Proposal**
Add a section on use of hierarchies to the standard guidance on [Establishing Publishing Policies](http://iatistandard.org/202/guidance/how-to-publish/establish-publishing-policies/). This should include:
</p><ul>
<li>The scope of use must not extend beyond the reporting of the activities of a single organisation. 
</li>
<li>All types of transactions may be reported at any level provided that:
<ul>
<li>There is no double counting across the activities of a single organisation. 
</li>
<li>Transactions should not report disbursements within a hierarchical group. The flow of money down a hierarchical chain is implicitly assumed
</li>
<li>Incoming Funds can be present at any level but must be reported only once and at only one level
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Budgets &amp; results can be defined at any number of levels
</li>
<li>All mandatory fields should be present at all levels. 
</li>
<li>Hierarchical groups should be treated as a single activity for the purpose of publisher statistics assessments
</li>
</ul>
**Standards Day**
Proposals were accepted. There was a wider discussion in the room around different use of hierarchy, described as hierarchy of relationship as well as hierarchy of funding flows. However, there was confusion around the definition being used for double counting and how that relates to reporting hierarchies. It was clarified that as long as the flow of resources is reported correctly, there will be no double counting. However, a number of examples were given from organisations highlighting that that there is inconsistency in how they use hierarchies and their understanding of double counting. The issue of treating hierarchical groups as single activities for publisher statistics assessments was not discussed.

          <title>Possibly change SDGs from sector to policy markers (excluded 2.03)</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[renatekersten]]></dc:creator>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p><strong>Title</strong><br>
possibly change SDGs to sector to policy markers</p>
<p><strong>Standard</strong><br>
Activity</p>
<p><strong>Schema Object</strong><br>
iati-activity/sector</p>
<p><strong>Type of Change</strong><br>
change schema object location of SDGs from sector to policy marker</p>
<p><strong>Issue</strong><br>
Since the SDGs are currently reported under the IATI sector codelists, you are obliged to include a percentage per SDG. However, determining how much an activity contributes to an SDG or how much of the budget is spent per SDG is very arbitrary. An activity can contribute 100% to several SDGs.</p>
<p><strong>Proposal</strong><br>
One solution would be to include the SDGs as a vocabulary under the policy markers. Another solution would be to use non-statitical sectors as proposed in the previous topic (<a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/non-statistical-secondary-sectors/849">Non-statistical secondary sectors (excluded 2.03)</a>)</p>

          <title>Our shared understanding of what IATI is, and is not,</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[rolfkleef]]></dc:creator>
          <category>2.03 Decimal Upgrade Proposals</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Over 105 organizations in The Netherlands have been working with, and publishing to the IATI Standard over the past two years. Based on these experiences, we feel it necessary to express our shared understanding of what IATI is, and is not. This shared vision provides<br>
the foundation of how we participate in the discussions around the 2.03 upgrade process and what we see as priorities.</p>
<p>We believe that IATI framework enables stakeholders to share representative “snapshots” and forward-looking information on activities. The information provided for the IATI framework is output from other financial and monitoring and evaluation systems, processes and workflows. IATI in itself does not replace these systems, processes and workflows and is not a suitable framework for full financial transparency or results accountability.</p>
<p>Any changes should be grounded in and supported by very clear ‘use cases’ and inline with a common understanding of what IATI is and is not. We propose that significant changes to the standard are only made based on experience and learnings gained from organizations publishing to the standard over the next two years. Making significant or several changes to the standard now will risk taking away the energy and capacity from publishers, users and tool builders. Instead of focusing on publishing results and financial information, they will spend several months updating their systems and tools</p>
<p>Many organisations are gaining experience using IATI to show progress on activities including financial transactions and projects results. We hope to continue this learning process and share in-depth stories about our ongoing experiences and use cases in the coming time. The <a href="https://www.drostan.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Partos-IATI-Results-2017-report-of-meetings.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">Partos workshop report on Working with Results within IATI</a> already highlights some of the lessons learned by organizations.  We propose to gather a variety of experiences, ours and those of others, in the next year (2017-2018), reflect together in a mini-TAG and then formulate informed change proposals for the standard.</p>
<p>We want to again emphasize our vision that IATI provides an overview to stakeholders on the progress of activity implementation and points to the location for further information provided by the publishing organization. IATI does not does not, and should not, capture all the details about an activity. Attempts to make IATI into a detailed financial report or monitoring and evaluation framework can result in the creation of a top-heavy, complex and burdensome framework.</p>
<p>Our focus should be on integrating IATI in organizational systems, processes and workflows and learn as much as we can from its current incarnation without making too many small or significant changes. Only by gaining this experience can we make informed suggestions and decisions on what needs to be changed in the standard.</p>

<p><strong>Standards Day</strong><br>
Workshopped at the TAG 2017 and mentioned at the end of the Standards day as part of the results section.  Although there was very little time to discuss the proposal, no criticism of the proposal was offered. Proposal has been on IATI Discuss since March 2017.</p>

<p><strong>Type of Change</strong><br>
Add a code to the codelist</p>
<p><strong>Issue</strong><br>
Some indicators can be expressed as numerical values but are not units or percentages. Most notable example: scales. At the moment, these can only be added by misrepresenting them as either units or percentages.</p>
<p><strong>Proposal</strong><br>
Since there are different types of scales and perhaps other types of quantitative indicators as well, adding a generic category “other” allows to stop misrepresenting the type of measure.</p>

            <p>This proposal is part of the <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/version-2-03-decimal-upgrade-index-of-proposals/838">2.03 upgrade process</a>, please comment by replying below.</p>
<p><strong>Standard</strong><br>
Activity</p>
<p>
**Schema Object**
iati-activity/transaction/related-reference/@ref
</p><p>
**Type of Change**
Schema addition
</p><p>
**Issue**
In an activity that involves earmarked funding from more than one funder it is currently not possible to trace the financial flow through the activity. This is of particular relevance to pooled funds. A reference shared between a commitment (or incoming funds transaction) and a disbursement would  clarify this.
</p><p>
**Proposal**
</p><ul>
<li>Add element iati-activity/transaction/related-reference
<ul>
<li>Definition: An internal reference that creates a link between two transactions within a single activity. The value in transaction/related-reference/@ref should be the same as transaction/@ref in another transaction.
</li>
<li>Occurs: 0..*
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add attribute iati-activity/transaction/related-reference/@ref
<ul>
<li>Definition: A value that matches the value in transaction/@ref in another transaction.
</li>
<li>Occurs: 1..1
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
**Standards Day**
This was a late presentation - part of a group of proposals that will improve humanitarian use of the standard - and was not discussed.

            <p>This proposal is part of the <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/version-2-03-decimal-upgrade-index-of-proposals/838">2.03 upgrade process</a>, please comment by replying below.</p>
<p><strong>Standard</strong><br>
Activity</p>
<p>
**Schema Object**
iati-activity/sector
</p><p>
**Type of Change**
Attribute and rule
</p><p>
**Issue**
There is currently no place in the standard to include tags, keywords or sector-type classifications that cannot be assigned a percentage split of the activity’s costs. Rather than create a new tag or keyword element it is proposed that the sector element can be adapted for this purpose.
</p><p>
**Proposal**
Add an attribute iati-activity/sector/@no-aggregation
</p><ul>
<li>Format: Boolean
</li>
<li>Definition: A flag to indicate that the sector specified is provided as additional information and should not be assigned a percentage in apportioning shares of the activity’s resources. The default value, if not present, is false.
</li>
</ul>
**Standards Day**
Proponents of this proposal cited that there is a clear user need for this. Others supported this as it would make activities more searchable. An alternative approach was also mentioned - i.e. the introduction of a 'tag' element. It was suggested that changes to the sector element may cause existing tools to break, and that the least disruptive approach should be taken.

            <p>This proposal is part of the <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/version-2-03-decimal-upgrade-index-of-proposals/838">2.03 upgrade process</a>, please comment by replying below.</p>
<p><strong>Standard</strong><br>
Activity</p>
<p><strong>Schema Object</strong><br>
iati-activity/default-aid-type/<span class="mention">@vocabulary</span><br>
iati-activity/default-aid-type/<span class="mention">@vocabulary-uri</span><br>

iati-activity/transaction/aid-type/<span class="mention">@vocabulary-uri</span></p>
<p><strong>Type of Change</strong><br>
Schema addition<br>
Codelist addition</p>
<p><strong>Issue</strong><br>
Defining types of aid (project-type interventions, budget support, debt relief, technical cooperation, etc) is a critical piece of data for users to understand and analyse IATI data. The global standard for this classification is the OECD DAC CRS Type of Aid codelist. This is currently the only list available in the IATI standard. There are, however, use cases in which additional information may be required to define the aid modality. The standard can accommodate this by allowing additional vocabularies from recognised sources to be used in addition to the DAC list.</p>
<p><strong>Proposal</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Allow for multiple occurrences of  iati-activity/default-aid-type and   iati-activity/transaction/aid-type elements
<ul>
<li>Occurs 
1..* 
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add attributes iati-activity/default-aid-type/@vocabulary and iati-activity/transaction/aid-type/@vocabulary
<ul>
<li>Definition
An code for the vocabulary aid-type classifications. If omitted the AidType codelist is assumed. The code must be a valid value in the AidTypeVocabulary codelist.
</li>
<li>Occurs
0..1
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add attributes iati-activity/default-aid-type/@vocabulary-uri and iati-activity/transaction/aid-type/@vocabulary-uri
<ul>
<li> Definition
The URI where this vocabulary is defined
</li>
<li>Occurs
0..1
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Guidelines
<ul>
<li>Each selected vocabulary should only be used once for each activity (iati-activity/default-aid-type) or transaction (iati-activity/transaction/aid-type)
</li>
<li>All activities and/or transactions should contain a code from the DAC Type of Aid Vocabulary
</li>
<li>The above guidelines should be converted to rules at the next integer upgrade.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add AidTypeVocabulary codelist
<ul>
<li>A non-embedded codelist should be created
</li>
</ul> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Standards Day</strong><br>
It was recommended that the IATI Technical Team and IATI WP-STAT members engage with the OECD DAC with regard to future modifications to the DAC Type of Aid codelist. There was also consensus that the vocabulary approach could provide more flexibility/granularity.</p>

<p><strong>Type of Change</strong><br>
Modify Definition</p>
<p><strong>Issue</strong><br>
Users of data should always be able to detect the hierarchical relationship between activities through inspection of the related activity element.</p>
<p><strong>Proposal</strong><br>
Modify definition of related-activity from:</p>
<ul><ul>
“Another separately reported IATI activity that is related to this one. The ‘type’ attribute describes the type of relationship: eg. parent, child, multifunded …”
</ul></ul>
to:
<ul><ul>
“Another separately reported IATI activity that is related to this one. The ‘type’ attribute describes the type of relationship: (eg. parent, child, multifunded. It is strongly recommended that linkage between activities in an hierarchical group should always be managed by use of this element with @type of 1 (parent) or 2 (child).”

          <title>Add budget-exempt attribute and codelist (included 2.03)</title>

            <p>This proposal is part of the <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/version-2-03-decimal-upgrade-index-of-proposals/838">2.03 upgrade process</a>, please comment by replying below.</p>
<p><strong>Standard</strong><br>
Activity</p>
<p><strong>Schema Object</strong><br>
iati-activity/<span class="mention">@budget-exempt</span></p>
<p><strong>Type of Change</strong><br>
Addition to Schema and Codelists</p>
<p><strong>Issue</strong><br>
One of the key goals of IATI is to improve the predictability of resource flows for users through the provision of forward-looking budgets. Users should expect IATI data to provide them with annual budget estimates across the lifetime of all activities. There are, however, circumstance under which forward-looking data cannot be provided, be it for operational, legal or commercial reason. This modification allows users to know which activities are exempt from providing budget data.</p>
<p><strong>Proposal</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Add attribute iati-activity/@budget-exempt
<ul>
<li>Definition
A code indicating the reason why this activity does not contain any iati-activity/budget elements. The value must exist in the BudgetExempt codelist.
</li>
<li>Occurs
0..1
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add non-embedded BudgetExempt codelist
<ul>
<li>Initial Values
1 - Commercial restrictions
2 - Legal restrictions
3 - Rapid onset emergency
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Standard</strong><br>
Activity and Organisation</p>
<p><strong>Schema Object</strong><br>
All uses of <span class="mention">@xml</span>:lang attribute</p>
<p><strong>Type of Change</strong><br>
Change Definition</p>
<p><strong>Issue</strong><br>
Xml:lang references the generic XML spec which allows for a range of languages, locales, regions and scripts. It is used in our schema with a more limiting definition - specifying sole use of ISO 639-1. This is not enforceable. Moreover, there are users who need to specify languages that aren’t on the ISO 639-1 list, but can be specified with BCP 47.</p>
<p><strong>Proposal</strong><br>
Change all definitions of xml:lang</p>
<ul>
<li>From
ISO 639-1 code specifying the language of text in this element.
</li>
<li>To
A code specifying the language of text in this element.It is recommended that wherever possible only codes from ISO 639-1 are used.

          <title>Boundary values for percentages (included 2.03)</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[IATI-techteam]]></dc:creator>
          <category>2.03 Decimal Upgrade Proposals</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>This proposal is part of the <a href="https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/version-2-03-decimal-upgrade-index-of-proposals/838">2.03 upgrade process</a>, please comment by replying below.</p>
<p><strong>Standard</strong><br>
Activity and Organisation</p>
<p><strong>Schema Object</strong><br>
All attributes containing percentages</p>
<p><strong>Type of Change</strong><br>
Modify definition</p>
<p><strong>Issue</strong><br>
Descriptions of percentage attributes in the schema state that the value must be a positive decimal number between 0 and 100. It is unclear whether whether the allowed  value is inclusive or exclusive of boundary values. Zero is unsigned (and so not a positive number), while it would be reasonable for a value of 100 to be set.</p>
<p><strong>Proposal</strong><br>
All percentages should be specified to be inclusive of boundary values.</p>
