Hi everyone, 

At Partos we started with our IATI training programme in may 2013 with a support programme for Dutch NGO&#39;s. As we&#39;ve learned a lot about a structured approach to IATI publication I created this posts to share what we&#39;ve learned and the training materials we are using.  Central in our approach is a focus on high quality data sets and the practical uses of IATI data for individual organisations. For this support we have developed and are developing tools that help organisation structure their IATI process. Big thanks to Rolf Kleef and Pelle Aardema from Open for Change with whom we created these tools. 

We started with enhancing the implementation schedule so it can serve as a step-by step guide to IATI implementation. The renewed implementation schedule helps organisation to structure their IATI implementation proces along four main steps. Starting to publish, planning to publish, data mapping and getting ready to publish. The Partos training programme is structured along the lines of these steps.
