    <title>UX Research for IATI- deadline 20 November</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/ux-research-for-iati-deadline-20-november/2044</link>
    <description>**IATI are seeking a UX Researcher to understand more about IATI publishers and the functionality they require as they publish to IATI.**

The IATI Governing Board has asked the Secretariat to conduct an options analysis to assess potential approaches to a publishing tool. While we have already learned a great deal about our diverse community of more than 1,200 publishers of different types and sizes, we need to understand more about our publishers and the functionality they require as they publish to IATI. This will enable us to analyse options for a publishing tool based on publisher input. All sizes of publishing organisations should be consulted as part of this exercise.

For more information, please see the [specific requirements and deliverables on this page](https://devinit.org/work-for-us/vacancies/independent-consultant-ux-researcher-iati/). Please share with your networks!


**Closing date:** 20 November 2020</description>
