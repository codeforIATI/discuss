    <title>Scheduled downtime for IATI Registry (Sunday 9 July 2017)</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/scheduled-downtime-for-iati-registry-sunday-9-july-2017/945</link>
    <description>The IATI Registry will be undergoing scheduled maintenance on Sunday (9th of July 2017) and will be unavailable from 00:00- 7:00 UK time. During this time, the website will not be browsable and the API will be offline.

This upgrade will not result in any changes to the way that users currently interact with the IATI Registry and, once complete, all data will be preserved. The purpose of this behind-the-scenes upgrade is ensure that users are able to benefit more quickly from new features when they are added, by bringing us into line with other underlying software (CKAN).

The IATI Technical Team will be working closely with our suppliers to ensure that this upgrade goes smoothly.

If you require any further information, please do get in touch with us by emailing support@iatistandard.org or by posting below.</description>
