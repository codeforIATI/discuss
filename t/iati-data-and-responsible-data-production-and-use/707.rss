    <title>IATI data and responsible data production and use</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/iati-data-and-responsible-data-production-and-use/707</link>
    <description>I want to start looking at IATI data and responsible data production and use. I talk to many organisations about the risks to themselves and their partners from publishing information using the IATI open data standard and  I&#39;m wondering if it is time we had some guidance on responsible data for organisations to follow when they are considering publishing to IATI. 

I&#39;d like to do something with the folks at the Responsible Data Forum and hopefully hitch up with the work they are doing with Hivos around Open Contracting: https://www.theengineroom.org/were-researching-the-responsible-data-challenges-of-open-contracting/ and https://responsibledata.io/

Anyone else interested in this? Let me know via this forum or to sjohns [at] bond [dot] org [dot] uk</description>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/sjohns">@SJohns</a> (or others), is anything being done in IATI community along the lines suggested above re responsible data, to your knowledge?</p>
