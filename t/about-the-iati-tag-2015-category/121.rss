    <title>About the IATI TAG 2015 category</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/about-the-iati-tag-2015-category/121</link>
    <description>The **IATI TAG** will be held in May 2015. 

As previously, the three main themes of the TAG this year will be:

•	**Getting it Right** – from first time publishers to those wanting to continually improve the quality of their data
•	**Using the Data** – how do we encourage and make it easy for people to use the wealth of IATI data?
•	**What Next?** – how do we evolve the standard and link up with other initiatives?

We want to use this discussion forum to begin thinking about the types of topics we want to include under those themes. 

But also to reflect on how we could run the TAG meeting – so we’d be interested to know what works well, what could we improve on, are there any innovative ideas from elsewhere that we could copy?

Get discussing!</description>
