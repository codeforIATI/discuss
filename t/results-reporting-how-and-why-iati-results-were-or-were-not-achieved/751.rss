            <p>Hi Sarah,<br>
No problem to discuss the result proposals in the regular decimal upgrade proces. They are definitely on the table. It would be helpfull if the proposals were in google document format, since it would allow for text suggestions and comments in the proposals  themselves.</p>

            <p>Thanks Herman for your response. We’d be happy to talk to you further about these proposals and would welcome your ideas on developing the technical proposals ready for consultation.</p>
<p>I would like to mention that these modifications are the result of consultation with IATI Standard users who are M and E specialists, and that they take into account problems with the Results element that have been identified and discussed for the last two years, including in a paper from 2015 which was shared on IATI Discuss and with Netherlands colleagues directly. All the working papers are openly available on IATI Discuss. Therefore it is imperative that it is included in the Standard upgrade consultation process, where there will be ample opportunity for others to engage and discuss the proposals.</p>

            <p>Hi Mike,<br>
Good to see you involved in the IATI discussion. I see that you posted a quite a lot of topics regarding results. Since these postings are only one day old I am a bit reluctant to discuss them on the TAG 2017 standards day. I suspect that many people are not aware of these postings and that there has been no proper time to review them thoroughly by the IATI community. Therefore I propose not to discuss these proposals on the standards day, but to move them to general discussion forum so that they can be discussed properly. We should be careful not to change the standard without proper consultation.</p>
