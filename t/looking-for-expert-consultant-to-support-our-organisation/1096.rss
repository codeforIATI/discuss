    <title>Looking for expert/consultant to support our organisation</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/looking-for-expert-consultant-to-support-our-organisation/1096</link>
    <description>We are looking for a consultant / expert, ideally based in Geneva (Switzerland) who could support our organization to:
1. analyse the data we have in our internal project management system
2. identify and assess the missing data to get IATI compliant
3. work with our IT department to ensure &quot;translation&quot; of our information into IATI format
Our organization is the International Trade Centre (ITC), the joint agency of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the United Nations. ITC&#39;s mission is to enable small business export success in developing and transition countries by providing, with partners, sustainable and inclusive trade development solutions to the private sector, trade support institutions and policymakers.
Many thanks in advance for your help.</description>

            <p>Good luck with the search Raphaelle.  I put it out on Twitter (with the link to this post). You may want to add a way for people to contact you directly if they’re interested?</p>
<p>This reminds me that there was a discussion at the TAG of creating some kind of repository/roster of IATI resources/experts. Consensus was that the easiest way to have an always up-to-date list would be for people with IATI expertise to self-identify as such on LinkedIn. I wonder if anyone actually did it?  Perhaps worth checking.</p>
