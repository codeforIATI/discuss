    <title>Request use of @narrative when using &#39;non-embedded - external&#39; codelists</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/request-use-of-narrative-when-using-non-embedded-external-codelists/1744</link>
    <description>There is no API access to code-lists classified as non-embedded - external&#39; e.g. the IASC Humanitarian Clusters which makes it very difficult to get meaningful (for humans) information on activities/transactions coded using these vocabularies.

The proposal is for cases when a non-embedded - external code-list is used, to request/require the user to add the @narrative element (as is currently done for 98/99 vocabularies) to give a some text reflecting the code.

The alternative is that all data users/systems maintain their own copies of all non-embedded - external code-lists, this is unreliable in many contexts. 

It is also highly inefficient compared to IATI maintaining these code-lists centrally, i.e. moving commonly used code-lists into the maintained category (and therefore available via the API) which is the other alternative.

See discussion [here](https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/help-develop-iati-s-humanitarian-reporting-guidance/530/22) and the guidance on sector @narrative [here](http://reference.iatistandard.org/203/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/sector/narrative/).</description>

            <p>I recognize that this can be an issue for data users.</p>
<p>However, I must note for the record that Canada would oppose requesting or requiring the use of <span class="mention">@narrative</span> for codelists, embedded or otherwise.</p>
<p>We would like to encourage the <a class="mention" href="/u/iati-techteam">@IATI-techteam</a> and community to explore other solutions to this issue.</p>
