    <title>Changes needed to activity scope codelist?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/changes-needed-to-activity-scope-codelist/527</link>
    <description>Just reviewing our IATI output for NGO Aid Map, and looking back again at the options in the [activity scope codelist](http://iatistandard.org/202/codelists/ActivityScope/). I know many organizations aren&#39;t reporting on sub-national location information, but the codes associated with sub-national location seem rather limited:

* 5: Sub-national: Multi-first-level administrative areas	
* 6: Sub-national: Single first-level administrative area	
* 7: Sub-national: Single second-level administrative area
* 8: Single location

Seems like these options should be consolidated into a single sub-national code, or made more exhaustive.</description>
