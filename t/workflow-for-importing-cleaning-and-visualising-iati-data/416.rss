    <title>Workflow for importing, cleaning and visualising IATI data?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/workflow-for-importing-cleaning-and-visualising-iati-data/416</link>
    <description>Hi, I wondered if anyone has ever written up their workflow for downloading (from API of their choice), cleaning up and visualising IATI data? It would be great to learn how others are working with IATI data. Is there a checklist or anything that exists?</description>

            <p>Hi Sarah, the general approach we take when analysing data and building tools (for example, the code which runs every day to generate the stats that power the Dashboard) is to assume that no publisher data is either complete complete or valid, as doing otherwise could cause breakages and  other unexpected outputs.</p>
<p>Do you have any specific problems that you’re tackling?</p>
<p>P.S. You’ve probably already come across the IATI Developer Documentation, which details various aspects of working with IATI data from a coding point of view), but I thought I’d add the link to be sure: <a href="http://iatistandard.org/202/developer/">http://iatistandard.org/202/developer/</a></p>
