    <title>[Added] to org-id (was Organisation Registration Agency) for Codice Fiscale (Italy) IT-CF</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/added-to-org-id-was-organisation-registration-agency-for-codice-fiscale-italy-it-cf/1040</link>
    <description>Following a request from an IATI publisher (email to support [at] org-id.guide) a new list has been proposed with the code IT-CF.

This addition to org-id.guide has been staged github.com/org-id/register/pull/67

**List title**: Codice Fiscale (Italy)

**List description**: 
Companies (and some other entities) in Italy must register with the Business Register of the Chambers of Commerce.

They are assigned a Codice Fiscale (CF) or Tax Code which also acts as their Partitia IVA (P.IVA) or VAT Number. 

Entities may also be assigned an Economic and Administrative Directory (REA) identifier.

**List access details:** An online search allows the existence of a company to be confirmed. To access identifiers requires registration, and the payment of a small fee to conduct a search that will return identifiers.

The Italian Agency for Development Cooperation (Agenzia Italiana per la Cooperazione allo Sviluppo or &#39;AICS&#39;) maintain a list of civil society organisations (&#39;Elenco CSO&#39;) registered with them. This includes those organsiations&#39; names and CF/P.IVA as well as other information (address, website) which can be found here http:// www.aics. gov. it/?page_id=7286.
  
**List search url**: www.registroimprese .it
