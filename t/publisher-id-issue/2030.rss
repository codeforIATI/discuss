    <title>Publisher ID issue</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/publisher-id-issue/2030</link>
    <description>Dear reader, 

I have been including transactions for my organization into AIDstream. I tried to publish our data to IATI but I repeatedly receive a pop-up warning that our publisher ID (under registry information) was not correct. However, I don&#39;t understand which publisher ID should be placed, because our IATI publisher ID is somehow not valid. 

If anyone can help me in this issue, I look very much forward to your reply. The AIDstream support desk was unfortunately not of any help. 

Warm regards from the Netherlands, 
Naomi</description>

            <p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/sjohns">@SJohns</a>, in this case there were two AidStream accounts set up for the same organisation. The first account was connected to the IATI Registry, which prevented the second one from being connected.</p>
<p>The AidStream devs were able to locate the original account and we could then sort the issue.</p>
<p>If you are struggling to connect your AidStream account to the Registry please do read their <a href="https://github.com/younginnovations/aidstream/wiki/How-do-I-register-to-IATI%3F">user guide</a> or e-mail us at <a href="mailto:support@iatistandard.org">support@iatistandard.org</a>.</p>
