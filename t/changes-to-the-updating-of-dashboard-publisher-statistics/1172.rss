    <title>Changes to the updating of dashboard publisher statistics</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/changes-to-the-updating-of-dashboard-publisher-statistics/1172</link>
    <description>The data on the [IATI dashboard](http://dashboard.iatistandard.org), including the[ Publisher Statistics](http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/summary_stats.html), are currently updated on a daily basis. This process now takes more than 24 hours, and the overlap is resulting in instability and unpredictable outcomes. 

The long-term solution to this will involve an overhaul of the underlying data architecture. In the short-term the update will now take place every three days. As from the 1st February 2018 it will be run shorty after midnight on the following days each month:
* 1st, 4th, 7th, 10th, 13th, 16th, 19th, 22nd, 25th. (and the 28th for months with 31 days)


**Timeliness calculations**

This has a potential impact on the way timeliness is assessed for those publishers who refresh their data once, and only once, a month. A publisher update made on the last day of the month will only be detected and recorded in the following month. Publishers who perform a monthly refresh of data between the 28th and 31st of January will not be counted for January only. This will not affect their[ overall &#39;monthly&#39; assessment](http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/timeliness.html#h_narrative) (which looks for updates in 7 or more of the past 12 full months AND data updated at least once in last 2 full months)</description>

<p>I’ve just sent a fix that reduces the processing time significantly. Benchmarking suggests it’s faster by about 18 hours: <a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Dashboard/pull/495">https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Dashboard/pull/495</a></p>

            <p>Good point, <a class="mention" href="/u/michelle_iom">@Michelle_IOM</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve created an issue on github: <a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Dashboard/issues/470">https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Dashboard/issues/470</a></p>
<p>…and have submitted a fix: <a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Dashboard/pull/471">https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Dashboard/pull/471</a></p>
<p>It turns out the dashboard mentions the ‘nightly update’ a lot. I’ve replaced all the occurrences I could find, but there may be more.</p>

            <p>Dear Bill,</p>
<p>Do you know if the dashboard will be updated for this new schedule?  It still says the dashboard is updated monthly?</p>
