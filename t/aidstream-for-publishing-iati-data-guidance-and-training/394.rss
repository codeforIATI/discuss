    <title>AidStream for publishing IATI data: Guidance and training</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/aidstream-for-publishing-iati-data-guidance-and-training/394</link>
    <description>If you are working with publishers who are using AidStream, please point them in the direction of https://www.bond.org.uk/effectiveness/aidstream. They will find a step by step guide* to using and publishing IATI data with AidStream, based on Bond&#39;s extensive experience of working with organisations on IATI. It&#39;s in English and we&#39;d love to get it translated into French, Spanish and Flemish or German if anyone is able to help! 

We also run one day workshops for CSOs on IATI. The workshop includes AidStream training and information about DFID and Dutch MFA guidelines: https://www.bond.org.uk/learning/introduction-to-iati-publishing-for-uk-ngos - this workshop is open to both UK and European CSOs.
