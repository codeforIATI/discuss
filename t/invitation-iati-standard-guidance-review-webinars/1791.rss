    <title>Invitation: IATI Standard guidance review webinars</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/invitation-iati-standard-guidance-review-webinars/1791</link>
    <description>The IATI technical team are inviting the IATI Community to join upcoming webinars on 1 August and 7 August to improve guidance provided on the IATI Standard. The deadline to sign-up is Friday 26 July.

**What will the webinars cover?**

The IATI technical team have rewritten and added additional content to existing IATI Standard guidance currently published on the [Activity](http://reference.iatistandard.org/203/activity-standard/overview/) and [Organisation](http://reference.iatistandard.org/203/organisation-standard/overview/) overview pages on [reference.iatistandard.org/](http://reference.iatistandard.org/). We want you to review the content and provide feedback:

* Review pieces of additional guidance
* Highlight and suggest areas of the guidance which could be better explained
* Identify gaps
* Provide use cases for IATI data where relevant

If you are interested in helping us, please send an e-mail to support@iatistandard.org indicating which (or both) of the webinars below you would like to join. We will share the guidance to be reviewed with participants before the webinars.

**Why rewrite IATI Standard guidance?**

The IATI technical team are undertaking this process as part of our ongoing project to consolidate and move IATI content across various older websites onto the [IATI Standard](https://iatistandard.org/en/) website, which was launched in 2018.

We hope to:

* Ensure the overview guidance pages are written in a user friendly language to help data publishers and users better understand the IATI Standard
* Add additional guidance for publishers to help improve the consistency of data published to IATI

*Do note:* 
We have split the overview guidance pages into various groups. The first two groups will be reviewed in the upcoming webinars and we will continue consultation on further areas of guidance throughout the year.

**Webinar dates**

* ***Webinar 1 Thursday 1 August 2pm - 3pm UK time***

    This webinar will cover 6 pages of guidance on activity dates, geography and sector information.

* ***Webinar 2 Wednesday 7 August 3:30pm - 4:30pm UK time***

    This webinar will cover 6 pages of guidance on activity and organisation financial information and publishing documents.

*Cannot attend?* 
If you are keen to review the updated guidance but cannot attend the webinars, you can still add your voice by providing written feedback. The webinars will be recorded and can be sent to you to listen. Please let us know.

**Sign-up by Friday 26 July**

To sign-up please e-mail support@iatistandard.org letting us know you are interested in being part of the process and state if/which webinars you can attend. We encourage you to share this invitation with relevant people in your networks.


Let us know if you have any questions and we look forward to working with you on this important piece of work!</description>
