    <title>Bug fix: @budget-not-provided contains a rule</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/bug-fix-budget-not-provided-contains-a-rule/1612</link>
    <description>At the 2.03 upgrade the attribute @budget-not provided was added:

    @budget-not-provided

    A code indicating the reason why this activity does not contain any iati-activity/budget elements. The value must exist in the BudgetNotProvided codelist.

    This value must be of type xsd:string.

    This value must be on the BudgetNotProvided codelist

The description contains a _rule_ that the attribute is only to be used when no budget elements are reported for the activity.

The IATI Technical team consider adding the rule more clearly as a must to be a bug fix. At the same time, we will remove the duplicated sentence to read:

     A code indicating the reason why this activity does not contain any iati-activity/budget elements. The code MUST only be used when no budget elements are present.

Unless an objection is received we plan to implement this pull request for version 2.03 of the Activity Standard after seven days.</description>

<p>^^ Maybe just me, but I find this sentence a bit difficult to parse.</p>
<p>I wonder if the following is clearer? (I’m not sure myself – it seems quite difficult to phrase this in a clear way!)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This attribute MUST NOT be set when one or more <code>budget</code> elements are present.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Also, I think we’re talking about an attribute here, rather than a code.)</p>
