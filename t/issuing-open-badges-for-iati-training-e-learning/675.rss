    <title>Issuing Open Badges for IATI training/e-learning</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/issuing-open-badges-for-iati-training-e-learning/675</link>
    <description>Hello, we are considering developing an open badge or badges to award participants of Bond&#39;s IATI training, so that they can track and share their achievements with their employers and via LinkedIn etc. Is anyone else exploring this or would be interested in exploring this with us? In the UK, employers are now adding IATI publishing into job descriptions and people are adding it to their CVs, so we thought it would be good time to trial this. We are also considering developing an e-learning module on IATI publishing, so again interested to know if anyone has experience of this or is interested in collaborating.</description>
