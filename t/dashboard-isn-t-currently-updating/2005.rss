    <title>Dashboard isn’t currently updating</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/dashboard-isn-t-currently-updating/2005</link>
    <description>I’ve [raised a ticket on github](https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Dashboard/issues/575), but flagging here as well for greater visibility:

[IATI Service Monitor](https://status.codeforiati.org/) is reporting that the dashboard was last updated more than 7 days ago. The timestamp in the footer suggests it was last updated on 5 August.

Is this a known issue? Thanks</description>

            <p>Hi Andy,</p>
<p>Thanks for flagging this. We’re aware that not all updates are happening as expected. Please do continue to log GitHub issues and we will investigate — at the moment we are all-hands-on-deck prioritising work on the Datastore and Validator in preparation for launch in a few weeks. We will investigate what’s going on with the Dashboard in due course.</p>

            <p>Hmm… Perhaps I spoke too soon. It looks like there have been more problems with sporadic updates (there were <a href="https://status.codeforiati.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">no updates for 9 days, according to IATI Status</a>).</p>
<p>Is there a known issue here? Thanks</p>

            <p>This looks resolved now – the dashboard appears to be updating daily again. Thanks!</p>
