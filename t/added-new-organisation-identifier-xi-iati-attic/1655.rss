    <title>[Added] New Organisation Identifier: XI-IATI-ATTIC</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/added-new-organisation-identifier-xi-iati-attic/1655</link>
    <description>The following addition to the [IATI Organisation identifier](http://iatistandard.org/203/codelists/IATIOrganisationIdentifier/) list has been proposed for the Association of Technicians in Information Technology and Communication (ATTIC), a non-political non-profit association in Republic of Chad. The request was [reviewed by org-id.guide](https://github.com/org-id/register/issues/319) for the most appropriate identifier, and it was concluded that no alternative organisation identifier is currently available.

**Code:** XI-IATI-ATTIC
**Name:** Association of Technicians in Information Technology and Communication (ATTIC)
**Description:** ATTIC aims to help develop and integrate the promotion of information and communication technologies in the development policy of the formal and non-formal sectors, to fight against food insecurity and poverty, by strengthening the means of vulnerable households, refugees, returnees and internally displaced persons, and by providing socio-professional training and integration for vulnerable groups.

If no objection is received, this XI-IATI code will be approved and added in a week.</description>
