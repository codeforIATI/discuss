    <description>Hello IATI Community,

I&#39;ve used the IATI Dashboard quite a lot recently to answer internal queries about our published data.

I was able to use the [DFID dashboard](http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/publisher/dfid.html) graph for Activities and the [JSON data](http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/stats/gitaggregate-publisher-dated/dfid/activities.json), which is slightly easier to analyse, to answer a question on publication dates - as DFID don&#39;t record this information internally, 

Does anyone else have examples of using the Dashboard to create reports or answer questions about their published data?</description>

            <p>Interesting stuff! It’s great to see the the Dashboard has the potential to inform decisions around traceability and publisher support.</p>
<p>I have a more low-tech example of how it can also help sidestep the barriers to analysis raised by data quality: when Development Initiatives was writing the <a href="http://devinit.org/?dialogFeatures=protocol=http#!/post/investments-to-end-poverty-2015" rel="nofollow noopener">2015 Investments to End Poverty Report</a> I helped in the construction of a budget analysis segment, which aimed to demonstrate how IATI data could use forward looking data to help recipient countries plan and manage funds.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the <a href="http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/forwardlooking.html" rel="nofollow noopener">forward looking</a> component of the Dashboard was great for scoping; helping us to evaluate how informative a given publisher’s data is, and guiding the analysis itself. The resulting section can be found on p.58 of the <a href="http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Investments-to-End-Poverty-Report-2015_online.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">report pdf</a>.</p>
<p>Very interested to hear other uses!</p>

            <p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/stevieflow">@stevieflow</a>, that’s really interesting!</p>
<p>It’s something that we have been thinking about in DFID as there are organisations that are publishing IATI activities which sit a few removed from the direct allocation of DFID money in our funding chain, but do not appear on DevTracker as they haven’t met our minimum data publication requirements.</p>
<p>In many cases the organisations have produced data which is very close to meeting the requirements, but just haven’t quite got it correct. An automated tool to help identify these activities &amp; organisations to provided the necessary nudge towards full complaince would be extremely helpful.</p>

            <p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/r_clements">@r_clements</a> - good question</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/bjwebb">@bjwebb</a> and I have been using some of the dashboard data to look at traceability (with Pontus at UN-Habitat).</p>
<p>Hence, this report: <a href="http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/OpenDataServices/iati-traceability/blob/master/unhabitat.ipynb" rel="nofollow noopener">http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/OpenDataServices/iati-traceability/blob/master/unhabitat.ipynb</a> - helps us see where the external references to an agency might appear, in this case looking at <code>participating-org</code> and <code>transaction/receiver-org</code> | <code>provider-org</code> for either 41120 or some strings (“Un Habitat” or “UN-Habitat” for example).</p>
<p>This “reverse mapping” (as I call it) data is already underneath the dashboard.  It would be good to polish this for general use (the scripts are here: <a href="https://github.com/OpenDataServices/iati-traceability/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/OpenDataServices/iati-traceability/</a> - we will document a little further) - but thought it also answered your query about ways people are using the dashboard   …</p>
