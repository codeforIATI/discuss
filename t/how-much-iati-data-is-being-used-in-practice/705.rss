    <title>How much IATI data is being used in practice?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/how-much-iati-data-is-being-used-in-practice/705</link>
    <description>I have been looking for data to understand resources for university building in my country. I have found data on webpage for example http://www.openaidsearch.org/ give good outline but it can be complicated to find and work with data in original format XML.

I notice main IATI webpage have words &quot;IATI makes information about aid spending easier to access, use and understand.&quot;. Also &quot;IATI Standard is a technical publishing framework allowing data to be compared&quot;.

I have one question: what are real world uses of IATI data?  How has this use had result of making better result in real world for everyone?

Thank you very much.</description>

            <p>I would add another question here: what is the best way to provide feedback about data published by an organization?</p>
