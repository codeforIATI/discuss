    <description>Interesting news articles in relation to (UK?) charities and the Common Reporting Standard (CRS).

* Civil Society -  [The Common Reporting Standard will ‘horribly affect’ some charities](http://www.civilsociety.co.uk/finance/news/content/21701/the_common_reporting_standard_will_horribly_affect_some_charities)
* Withers - [Wake up call for charities – the Common Reporting Standard is here](http://www.withersworldwide.com/news-publications/wake-up-call-for-charities-%E2%80%93-the-common-reporting-standard-is-here)

Would be interested in any thoughts on this about where IATI may or may not fit in, and the general tone of this coverage.  maybe colleagues at Bond may be aware --&gt; @SJohns @Michael.ODonnell</description>
