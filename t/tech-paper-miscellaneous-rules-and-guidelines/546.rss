    <description>**Make Rules and Guidelines part of the Standard**

[The initial submission for Version 2.01](http://support.iatistandard.org/entries/41586986-Overview-of-Version-2-01) of the standard proposed that a number of elements contained in IATI&#39;s general guidance should be included in the standard itself: namely [timeliness](http://support.iatistandard.org/entries/41582966-General-Guidance-on-timeliness) and [multi-level reporting](http://support.iatistandard.org/entries/40759343-General-rules-for-multi-level-reporting) (see[ current paper on hierarchies](http://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/tech-paper-hierarchies/539)). A[ meeting of the Steering Committee](http://support.iatistandard.org/entries/45539933-Thematic-content-agreed-by-IATI-Steering-Committee) in March 2014 agreed &quot;that more work needs to be done on bringing general guidance into the formal standard, so this should be excluded&quot; from the 2.01 upgrade. 

We think the time is ripe for reconsidering how a number of key features of IATI that cannot be controlled by the XML Schema could be included in the Standard

**Implementation Schedules**

Implementation schedules played a key role in capturing the intentions of publishers in the early years of the Standard. This proposal will recommend that their usefulness has run its course.

**Status of Publishers (IATI Registry)**

The [Registry](https://iatiregistry.org/) reports that over 500 Organisations have published. Our [publishing statistics](http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/comprehensiveness.html) show, however, that 100 of these are not reporting any current information. There is a need to classify publishers that are dormant or have been merged, liquidated, etc.

**Timeliness**

Is it time for timeliness guidelines to be included in the standard?
