    <title>Can you pledge to increase the use of IATI data?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/can-you-pledge-to-increase-the-use-of-iati-data/558</link>
    <description>Are you committed to supporting transparency and open data in development and humanitarian financing? Do you want developing country governments to have accurate information on the resources available to them? Do you want journalists and CSOs to have the data they need to hold governments and assistance providers to account? 

If yes, we need your help. 

We’ve already received 78 pledges from over 30 [member organisations](http://www.aidtransparency.net/governance/members-assembly) from across the IATI community. Take a look at our[ IATI data use pledge wall](http://www.aidtransparency.net/news/can-you-help-increase-iati-data-use) from our [Members’ Assembly meeting](http://www.aidtransparency.net/governance/members-assembly/annual-members-assembly-meeting) in June.

With information published to the IATI Standard by nearly 500 different organisations across the world, we are determined to increase the use of this information. That’s why our members have just agreed to place data use at the heart of our [strategic direction](http://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Paper-3-Board-Paper-on-Strategic-direction-for-IATI-2016-2018.pdf) and why we’ll bring the IATI community together to deliver your pledges. 

Post your pledges below and for more information, get in touch with the IATI Secretariat: [info@iatistandard.org](mailto:info@iatistandard.org).</description>
