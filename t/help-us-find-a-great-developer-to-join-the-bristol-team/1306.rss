    <title>Help us find a great developer to join the Bristol team!</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/help-us-find-a-great-developer-to-join-the-bristol-team/1306</link>
    <description>We are recruiting for another developer to join the Bristol team and we&#39;d really value your help in promoting this role with your networks.

**Senior Full Stack Developer – IATI**
Full time, fixed term contract until August 2019, based in Bristol, UK
If you want a job that uses your tech skills to make the world a better place, this is the role for you. We’re at a pivotal time and are building the technology that will help IATI become even more successful. You can expect lots of interesting conceptual and technical challenges – for example how to keep track of and efficiently run statistics on the millions of data points that make up IATI data, many of which are updated and hosted individually by our publishers.

You will have:

* Good knowledge of Python and Django
* Experience of version control systems – we use Git and Github
* Good knowledge of front end JavaScript technologies (AngularJS, JQuery or similar)
If you would like to make a positive impact working alongside driven and friendly colleagues committed to ending poverty, we would love to hear from you. Please read the [full role profile](http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IATI-Senior-Full-Stack-Developer.pdf) with details on how to apply.</description>
