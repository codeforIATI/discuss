    <title>Nepal Earthquake: tagging IATI data</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/nepal-earthquake-tagging-iati-data/174</link>
    <description>Hello, it would be good to talk humanitarian at the TAG - is there going to be a session? In particular, how to tag data as relating to a particular emergency response (I&#39;m thinking Nepal earthquake here) and record funding and results at the end of the 90 day response period. (Not thinking of IATI as coordination mechanism as there are other better things for that). Has anyone got  prior experience of this? I know that there were conversations on here last year, but nothing resolved.</description>

            <p>Bibhusan (and others) — have you had a chance to look at the 3W for the aid<br>
response? OCHA Nepal is compiling and releasing it 2×/week — it’s very<br>
similar to IATI Activity data, but without the financial information.</p>

            <p>Hi I just wanted to cross-post this in case it was useful in relation to this thread.</p>
<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I wanted to reach out to this list for some advice on a project we are trying to get up and running in Nepal. We are trying to set up an Inter-Agency Common Feedback projectthat integrates field assessment data, possibly a call-centre, reporting from radio and media partners, and other complaint mechanisms into a common platform. Specific complaints would be referred back to the responsible organizations with some sort of accountability mechanism, but overall the goal is to integrate this data into a Common Data Hub that would be used to improve the response, by strengthening the voice of affected communities. This is more ambitious a project than has been attempted before. We are trying to work through all of the privacy and protection issues and what is feasible in terms of accountability, as well as how to weight different inputs.</p>
<p>Also there are a lot of questions around technical platforms, for example, we were offered PowerBI analytical suitefor the Common data Hub but weren’t sure if there were other open-source platforms that might make sense, or whether something could be developed over the next few months. For the field assessment, they are talking about using something based off of the Kobo Toolkit; UNICEF is also rolling out its U-Report there has been discussion of working with Ground Truth Project by Key Stone Accountability.</p>
<p>The proposal is here (<a href="http://reliefweb.int/report/nepal/inter-agency-common-feedback-project-nepal-earthquake-2015" rel="nofollow noopener">http://reliefweb.int/report/nepal/inter-agency-common-feedback-project-nepal-earthquake-2015</a>) (which is pretty general) but wanted to see if anyone had experience with similar projects, or would be able to provide advice on either the accountability or technical aspects.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
Daniel</p>

<p>Hi Sarha… Good to see that you have started this thread… We’ve been working on a transparency of Earthquake aid at <a href="http://earthquake.opennepal.net" rel="nofollow noopener">http://earthquake.opennepal.net</a> So far, we’ve been using data from OCHA FTS, Government sources and media reports.</p>
<p>We are looking to make the data here compatible to IATI standard. We would be willing to share our approach,  experience and challenges of doing so in the proposes session if that makes sense</p>
<p>Bibhusan</p>

            <p>The de-facto standard for tagging crises is GLIDE: <a href="http://www.glidenumber.net" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.glidenumber.net</a></p>
<p>Since we can end up with more than one GLIDE number for the same crisis, other humanitarian data providers and sites tend to look to ReliefWeb to see what number they’re using, and they copy it. I think that you’ll find GLIDE numbers in the FTS data (though I’d have to confirm).</p>
<p>It goes without saying that I’m <em>very</em> willing to participate in a humanitarian session.</p>

            <p>Hi Sarah,<br>
Yes, there will absolutely be a session at the TAG to move the discussions on a humanitarian marker forwards. This is something that the technical team has been working on for a while now with the key humanitarian actors (e.g. the Financial Tracking Service (FTS) at OCHA) and it will be good to take another step forward in the process at the TAG.</p>
