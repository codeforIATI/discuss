    <description>Hi all,

In Irish Aid, we are just ready now, to start preparing files for publication. We are unfamiliar with version 2 and I was wondering if there is any other agency that you are aware of preparing files in a similar way to ourselves: extracting financial info from SUN using Q&amp;A excel. And mapping to the standard. IF you know of any other agency that uses this, or a similar method (no proj mgt or aid mgt platform - basically extracting from FMS to spreadsheets), please let me know. I would appreciate getting in touch
