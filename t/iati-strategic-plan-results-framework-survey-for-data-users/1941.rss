    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/iati-strategic-plan-results-framework-survey-for-data-users/1941</link>
    <description>In line with its [2020-2025 Strategic Plan](https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fiatistandard.org%2Fen%2Fgovernance%2Fiati-strategic-plan-2020-2025%2F&amp;data=02%7C01%7Canna.whitson%40undp.org%7C277cbae85d6b45c1909d08d7e6e1d827%7Cb3e5db5e2944483799f57488ace54319%7C0%7C0%7C637231729981460839&amp;sdata=4jZGulw3DTO0XLhBR5gSQor%2F5r1rUsewKFxGb%2F6b1TM%3D&amp;reserved=0), the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) is reinforcing efforts to track the quality and use of IATI data and the strength of IATI community engagement.

As such, a Results Framework for the Strategic Plan is under development, which will ensure that decisions on the future of IATI are based on real progress, and that this progress can be tracked and shared. To establish baselines for the Results Framework, IATI is inviting all colleagues who **accessed or used IATI data in 2019 to complete this** [brief survey](https://bit.ly/IATIdatausesurvey) by **15 May**.
### [ **Take IATI Strategic Plan Results Framework Survey - for Data Users** ](https://bit.ly/IATIdatausesurvey)

The survey should take approximately five minutes to complete and is open to any person who accessed or used IATI data in 2019. **Please do not complete this survey if you have already responded to the Members / Publishers survey.**  Please note that your responses will not be shared beyond the IATI Secretariat, other than in aggregated analysis. Kindly direct any questions on the survey to Secretariat member Anna Whitson at [anna.whitson@undp.org](mailto:anna.whitson@undp.org).

Your input will be vital to IATI&#39;s efforts to track progress and hold ourselves accountable to our mandate of improving the transparency of development and humanitarian resources and their results to address poverty and crises.

We thank you in advance for participating!

Best,
The IATI Secretariat</description>
