            <p>Just to flag that there appear to be issues with 3 of the 4 unique links in the original proposal.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The URL link for the Department of Education, Northern Ireland appears invalid, although appending ‘x’ does work - i.e. <a href="http://apps.education-ni.gov.uk/appinstitutes/instmain.asp">http://apps.education-ni.gov.uk/appinstitutes/instmain.asp</a> -&gt; <a href="http://apps.education-ni.gov.uk/appinstitutes/instmain.aspx">http://apps.education-ni.gov.uk/appinstitutes/instmain.aspx</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All links to <a href="http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk">http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk</a> pages show a timeout.  It appears this site has been replaced with the <a href="https://education.gov.scot">https://education.gov.scot</a> domain.<br>
In terms of a searchable public database, it appears that the <a href="https://education.gov.scot/parentzone/find-a-school">https://education.gov.scot/parentzone/find-a-school</a> page has functionality to search by school name rather than SEED number.</p>

            <p>AS IRN relates to the number used by the Department of Education, Northern Ireland rather than the organisation itself, it is proposed that a code of GB-DOENI should be used rather than GB-IRN</p>
