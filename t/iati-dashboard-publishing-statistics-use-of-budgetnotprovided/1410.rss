    <title>IATI Dashboard &gt; Publishing Statistics - use of BudgetNotProvided?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/iati-dashboard-publishing-statistics-use-of-budgetnotprovided/1410</link>
    <description>The IATI Dashboard contains a metric for provision of the [Budget element in Comprehensiveness](http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/comprehensiveness_financials.html).

&gt; For the hierarchy which contains the greatest number of budgets, the percentage of all current activities that contain at least one valid budget entry. A valid budget entry must contain a valid period-start AND a valid period-end AND a valid value AND a valid value-date.

In 2.03 a new attribute was introduce [@budget-not-provided](http://reference.iatistandard.org/203/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/#iati-activities-iati-activity-budget-not-provided):

&gt; A code indicating the reason why this activity does not contain any iati-activity/budget elements. The value must exist in the BudgetNotProvided codelist.

The question therefore - do activities with the @budget-not-provided attribute get omitted from the Dashboard budget metric?</description>

<p>The answer at present is: No.</p>
<p>There are two relevant github issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Dashboard/issues/454">Forward looking - requires changes (#454)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Dashboard/issues/455">Comprehensiveness financials - requires changes (#455)</a></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>More generally: There are other outstanding issues regarding the v2.03 upgrade. Some of these relate to the standard itself (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Codelists/pull/139">[1]</a>; <a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Codelists-NonEmbedded/pull/242">[2]</a>; possibly others). It would be great to fully review the remaining issues, and set a timeline for resolving these issues.</p>
