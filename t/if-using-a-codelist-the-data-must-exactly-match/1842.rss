    <title>If using a codelist, the data must exactly match</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/if-using-a-codelist-the-data-must-exactly-match/1842</link>
    <description>The new [SDG guidance] :) (https://docs.google.com/document/d/11vsqHc-mdAYUCqrrGCaCTFxu48oD3VvBVSlY9Q3ideo/edit) states that: &quot;IATI recommends that if a publisher’s internal indicators do not directly match any SDG Indicator, they should choose one SDG Indicator that their internal result’s indicator best relates or contributes to.&quot;

I think this breaks how IATI works and am very surprised that this is allowed as this means that data users cannot rely on the data being supplied by a publisher, exactly matching the codelist entry that it is marked as.

This means that if a user were to aggregate all the baselines for a particular SDG indicator, they would not know that in some cases, the baseline data provided, is actually for a different indicator, not the one they are expecting, and therefore their conclusions from using this data would be false.

IATI needs to find a way to use existing tools e.g. the `&lt;legacy-data&gt;` element, or a new element, to allow publishers to indicate whether the data they are supplying is from a similar, but not exactly the same indicator/sector etc to that described by the codelist which they have used to mark it. This could easily done by an attribute i.e. `match=not_exact` or similar.</description>
