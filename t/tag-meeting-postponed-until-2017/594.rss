    <title>TAG meeting postponed until 2017</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/tag-meeting-postponed-until-2017/594</link>
    <description>We’re sorry to let you know that the TAG 2016 will be postponed until early next year. We apologise to those who were planning to attend and for any inconvenience caused.
 
Over the last few months, the IATI Secretariat had been preparing for this year’s TAG to be held in Addis Ababa. However, this week the Ethiopian government declared a state of emergency for the next six months. After much consideration, the Secretariat, TAG Chair and IATI Governing Board agreed it was sensible to avoid the possibility of cancelling nearer to the date of the event and decided to postpone the meeting until early 2017. 
 
We are currently looking for an alternative location and will confirm the details shortly. In the meantime, you can still get involved with preparations:
 
**Run a session at the TAG - deadline extended**
We have extended the deadline to submit proposals to run a session at the TAG meeting to **Friday 25 November**. We encourage you come forward to share new ideas and projects with the IATI community, or discuss a burning issue that needs exploring. Please [get in touch](http://mailto:tag@iatistandard.org) if you want to discuss a TAG session idea with us. 
 
We will continue to update you with further announcements, along with TAG discussion topics from IATI’s Technical Team.

Once again, we’re sorry for any inconvenience caused and look forward to seeing you early next year.</description>
