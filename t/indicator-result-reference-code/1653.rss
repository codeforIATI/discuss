    <title>Indicator/result reference code</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/indicator-result-reference-code/1653</link>
    <description>We offer reference code vocabularies for results and indicators. While trying to resolve some data processing issues, I had a few observations on how to improve orthogonality of the standard.

* For indicators, it says &quot;Multiple vocabularies may be specified, but each vocabulary may be specified only once for each indicator.&quot;. For results, this is not specified.
* This makes it impossible to use two different reference codes from two separate organisation-specific vocabularies (for instance to include a partnership-specific code).
* For sectors, we added code &quot;98&quot; to have the option of a second organisation-specific vocabulary. These could be included in the result and indicator vocabularies as well.
* For sectors and results, it is possible to add an attribute @vocabulary-uri to specify which vocabulary is used. For indicators, this attribute is called @indicator-uri, although it is described as a vocabulary uri too.

A bit of a mixed bag. I think the &quot;98&quot; codes could be added in a decimal upgrade, the rest probably could be taken into account for a major upgrade?</description>
