    <title>Are the OrganisationRole codes what we need?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/are-the-organisationrole-codes-what-we-need/574</link>
    <description>Flagging this as a discussion leading up to the TAG 2016

We have four [OrganisationRole codes](http://iatistandard.org/202/codelists/OrganisationRole/) in IATI.  I believe this have been constant since the first version:

* Funding
* Accountable
* Extending
* Implementing

Questions we might want to discuss

- Are these four &quot;working&quot;?  There was a discussion around removal / definition of the Accountable code at the TAG in 2014 [here](http://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/question-about-deprecation-of-code-list-organisation-role-accountable/39) and [here](http://support.iatistandard.org/entries/41095068-Deprecate-code-list-organisation-role-accountable) 
- Does the community present any use-cases for new additional OrganisationRoles?  In passing, I&#39;ve heard ideas for &quot;Partner&quot; and &quot;Lead Implementor&quot; - but these are just examples.  

It would be useful to understand if others have any feedback or requirements around this list - particularly as it can be a crucial part of the standard to help describe complex arrangements in development co-operation</description>
