    <title>Looking for Experts/Consultants IATI</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/looking-for-experts-consultants-iati/1075</link>
    <description>Hi,

I am working for a Belgian Federation (Fiabel). As from 2018, our members are  obligated to report in IATI. Most of them will be using Aidstream but some will be working directly from their own internal database.  We are looking for experts/consultants who can assist our members to prepare their internal databases for IATI reporting (and ensure data can directly transformed to IATI standard). Any advice? (we are based in Brussels) 
Thanks, Ruth Beeckmans, Policy Advisor Fiabel</description>

            <p>Dear Ruth,</p>
<p>We as Data4Develoment have supported a large number of Dutch NGOs with their IATI publications since the beginning of 2016 when the Dutch Ministry started to use the IATI standard. For this purpose we have developed a.o. a spreadsheet2IATI tool, that is relatively easy for organisations to use.  We support this tool with tailor made advice and data quality feed back to improve the publications.</p>
<p>If you are interested, please get in touch at maaike@data4development.nl</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Maaike</p>

            <p>We went through this and in our case it was relatively painless.  Would be happy to expand on what we did and how we did it.</p>

            <p>You’ll need someone to implement this who knows SQL databases well, but we have released our internal tool that generates IATI data from our internal databases.</p>
