    <title>Data in Bosnia/Herzegovina</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/data-in-bosnia-herzegovina/699</link>
    <description>I look on IATI data page https://www.iatiregistry.org/dataset?q=&amp;publisher_source_type=&amp;secondary_publisher=&amp;organization=&amp;publisher_country=&amp;publisher_organization_type=&amp;country=Bosnia+And+Herzegovina&amp;filetype= for data on my country for university building.

There is lots of data on page but how do person find data for particular type activity.  I see a lot of data in format XML, is the data in one particular file?

Thank you very much.</description>

            <p>Hi Zlantan,</p>
<p>From my side – what I use depends on what exactly I want. As a really quick run-down:</p>
<p>•	<strong>Who is spending what:</strong> I go to the donor organisational file of the donor on the Registry.It’s not a very user-friendly way, and there are ways of getting this data from d-portal but I’m not sure how to (if anybody knows, please share!).</p>
<p>There is pretty useful data in there. As an example, I can tell you that the US has a 2017 budget of $43 million for <a href="http://preview.iatistandard.org/index.php?url=http%3A//beta.foreignassistance.gov/assets/Organisations/DOS%2520and%2520USAID.xml" rel="nofollow noopener">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> and that $60,000 of that is directed to higher education. With this sort of information, I start identifying the funding flows of different donors.</p>
<p>I’d like to see a more user-friendly way of getting at this data so a) no need for Registry and b) I can see data from more than one donor at once. That said, there might be a way I just don’t know about.</p>
<p>•	<strong>What’s going on?</strong> When I want to take an overall scan of what is happening in a specific country (either entirely or by donor / sector), I go to the <a href="http://datastore.iatistandard.org/query/" rel="nofollow noopener">query-builder</a>.</p>
<p>This is a really helpful tool which lets you download the data into a spreadsheet (make sure to select “entire selection on the top right, otherwise it just gives you a sample). If you click <a href="http://datastore.iatistandard.org/api/1/access/activity.csv?sector=11420&amp;recipient-country=BA&amp;stream=True" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>, it will download the higher education activities in Bosnia and Herzegovina. From this, I can see all sorts of information but what is relevant entirely depends on what I am doing. It can serve as a useful way of finding a specific project, which I might dig into more. the Query Builder doesn’t show you everything (like locations), but it’d be cool if it / something else could.</p>
<p>For the sake of this exercise though – a really quick scan tells me that quite a few donors focus efforts on scholarship, but let’s say I want to learn more about Sweden….</p>
<p>•	<strong>How does it fit together?</strong> This is usually when I go to d-portal, which I usually rely on to show me how different projects fit together. I can search Sweden’s activities in Bosnia and Herzegovina which returns <a href="http://www.d-portal.org/ctrack.html?search&amp;country=BA&amp;funder=SE&amp;sector_group=114#view=main" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a>. For the sake of time I randomly selected this <a href="http://www.d-portal.org/ctrack.html?search&amp;country=BA&amp;funder=SE&amp;sector_group=114#view=act&amp;aid=SE-0-SE-6-7600350301-BIH-11420" rel="nofollow noopener">project</a>, where I can see the details such as who is involved etc (much the same as in the spreadsheet but more user-friendly). It provides me links to documents so I can research more into their strategy, outcomes etc. It also shows me how it links with other projects taking place in that country / region.</p>
<p>Again, it really depends on what you want to do. Sometimes I just use the query builder, for example.</p>
<p>There’s also still constraints on how useful I find the data (often depending on the publisher’s data quality) when conducting analyses etc., however, there’s projects out there who are working to fill in some of those gaps – like the <a href="https://www.interaction.org/project/open-ag-funding/overview" rel="nofollow noopener">Open Ag project</a> (disclaimer: I’m involved!), so hopefully things will keep moving in the right direction.</p>
<p>Hope this is useful and feel free to drop me a line if I can help.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the question <a class="mention" href="/u/zlatan08">@zlatan08</a> and I wonder if you might find some of the other online IATI based tools useful? Such as <a href="http://www.d-portal.org/">http://www.d-portal.org/</a> or <a href="http://www.openaidsearch.org/">http://www.openaidsearch.org/</a></p>
