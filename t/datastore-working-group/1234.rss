    <title>Datastore Working Group?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/datastore-working-group/1234</link>
    <description>Following January’s IATI Developers’ Workshop in Manchester, [the blog post writeup](https://www.aidtransparency.net/news/iati-developers-workshop-what-we-achieved) from @bill_anderson and @JohnAdams included the following:

&gt; **We agreed that the Datastore is a key element in the future IATI infrastructure, and that it should focus on delivering IATI data in different formats that people can use to build information products.**

It also listed the following practical achievement from the workshop:

&gt; A working group to advise on governance, functionality and oversight of a new datastore.

This idea sounds good to me. Can I ask what the plan is for forming this working group? What needs to happen to progress it?

As a [contributor to the datastore codebase](https://github.com/iati/iati-datastore/pulls) and [issue tracker](https://github.com/iati/iati-datastore/issues), I’d be glad to join. Perhaps others interested in joining could also add their names to this thread?</description>

            <p>Also interested in hearing more about the working group, including whether it would be focused on technical issues or would include a user perspective?  I’d be happy to help if I can.</p>
