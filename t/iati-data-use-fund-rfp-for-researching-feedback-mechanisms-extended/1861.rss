    <title>IATI Data Use Fund: RfP for researching feedback mechanisms extended</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/iati-data-use-fund-rfp-for-researching-feedback-mechanisms-extended/1861</link>
    <description>The deadline for the RfP on researching feedback mechanisms has been extended to the **25th October.**

Please see the following message from the IATI Secretariat:

---------------------------------------------------

Under the auspices of the IATI Data Use Task Force, UNDP is seeking to contract a service provider who has the capacity to conduct extensive research on options for a web-based feedback mechanism between IATI data users and publishers. The aim of this project is to provide recommendations to IATI on how a feedback mechanism could be designed and implemented with the ultimate goal of improving the quality of data published to IATI.

The service provider is expected to develop the concept and conduct the research (in coordination with the IATI Coordinator who is based at UNDP), document research results and provide UNDP with a final report that contains detailed information and recommendations for a web-based feedback loop.

**We would therefore appreciate if you could circulate this [Request for Proposal](http://procurement-notices.undp.org/view_file.cfm?doc_id=192002), which contains additional relevant information, among any firms or vendors who might be interested.**

The deadline for receipt of proposals has been extended to  **Friday, 25 October** and bids should be submitted through the official [UNDP procurement portal](http://procurement-notices.undp.org/view_notice.cfm?notice_id=59553). Any questions on the contents of the RfP or the process of submitting a bid can be directed to Anna Whitson at [anna.whitson@undp.org](mailto:anna.whitson@undp.org).</description>
