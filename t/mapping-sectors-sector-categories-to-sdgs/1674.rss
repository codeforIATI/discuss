    <title>Mapping Sectors/Sector Categories to SDGs</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/mapping-sectors-sector-categories-to-sdgs/1674</link>
    <description>I&#39;m trying to use IATI data to show how activities are implemented towards achieving the SDGs in Kenya. However, I have realized that a number of activities have not captured SDGs information though they have sectors and/or sector category information. Is there a mapping of Sectors/Sector Categories to SDGs or any other field that I can use to link activities to SDG(s) ?</description>

</aside>
<p>Actually, the DAC recently agreed that SDG goals &amp; targets should be used as tags, not sectors, in CRS+.</p>
<p>The good news is that there’s a tag-element in the IATI standard that can be used for this purpose as well. The bad news is that the SDG codes have not yet been added to the tag-element vocabulary codelist, so for the time being a vocabulary code 99 would have to be used for publishers wishing to align on the DAC CRS+ standard.</p>

            <p>I’ve been asked this question a couple of times too as more organisations are now aligning their work with particular goals/indicators. Thanks <a class="mention" href="/u/matmaxgeds">@matmaxgeds</a> for the info on Kenya. I wonder also how many organisations know that they can add the SDG goals/indicators as a second vocab option after adding the OECD DAC sector codes?</p>

            <p>Hi Simon,</p>
<p>I had another thought - many of the IATI projects you can find in epromis e.g. this <a href="http://e-promis.treasury.go.ke/e-promis/report.jsp?&amp;reportId=2294&amp;isForDashboard=false&amp;isSavedReport=true&amp;appPath=null&amp;sessionId=155118534790113231&amp;languageId=null&amp;refineFilters=null&amp;subModuleId=2&amp;printHtml=null" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a> from the list of the left <a href="http://e-promis.treasury.go.ke/e-promis/#/Eng/PROJECTS/Report/1_1_1_2" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a> and that would mean you could lookup which Ministry GoK thinks the project is under, and from there perhaps use the MTP which should have Ministry &gt; SDGs?</p>

            <p>Hi Simon,</p>
<p>I am not sure there is an ‘official’ one. I am guessing that most of the projects with sectors/sector categories but not SDG information are using OECD DAC CRS codes - and the OECD did make an attempt at mapping these to the SDGs, see <a href="http://www.oecd.org/officialdocuments/publicdisplaydocumentpdf/?cote=DCD/DAC/STAT(2015)9&amp;docLanguage=En" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a> however the last thing I saw was that in 2018 they were <a href="http://www.oecd.org/officialdocuments/publicdisplaydocumentpdf/?cote=DCD/DAC/STAT(2018)41&amp;docLanguage=En" rel="nofollow noopener">planning an SDG field in the CRS database</a> which suggests that their 2015 mapping wasn’t good enough for their needs - it may be for yours.</p>
<p>The other way is to figure out a mapping from the OECD DAC sectors to the national Medium Term Plan, as I belive there is a mapping in the MTP III (and also from National Statistics) to the SDGs done by the government which you could then use? There is a field in IATI for <a href="http://reference.iatistandard.org/202/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/country-budget-items/budget-item/" rel="nofollow noopener">country budget item</a> which would make this route very easy, but as far as I am aware, it is almost never used.</p>
<p>I guess all of this is easier if you just need a rough estimate and broad sectors but even then it is a lot of work. I hope that helps and it would be great to see what you come up with at the end.</p>
<p>Matt</p>
