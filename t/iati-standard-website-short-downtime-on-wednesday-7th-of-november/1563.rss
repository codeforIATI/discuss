    <title>IATI standard website- short downtime on Wednesday 7th of November</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/iati-standard-website-short-downtime-on-wednesday-7th-of-november/1563</link>
    <description>Users will not be able to access iatistandard.org and reference.iatistandard.org from 8am (BST) on Wednesday 7th of November 2018. This is due to a server upgrade and following backup restore. We expect these operations to take 1/1.5 hours.

During this time, users will still be able to publish and access data via the [IATI Registry](https://iatiregistry.org/).

If you have any questions, please email support@iatistandard.org.</description>
