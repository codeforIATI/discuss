    <title>Creating a &#39;suspended&#39; function for IATI activity files on the Registry/Dashboard?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/creating-a-suspended-function-for-iati-activity-files-on-the-registry-dashboard/308</link>
    <description>Hi

I&#39;ve been working recently with Save the Children UK who have some files failing on the Dashboard. This is because they have removed URLs to their data; either because the data has been deemed too sensitive or because SCUK only publish activities in implementation phase. 

However, they may choose to re-link data to that activity file in the future with exclusions or if the country becomes less politically contentious, and they are likely going to publish historical data in addition to implementation data.

In this case, it does not seem appropriate to delete the Activity file or link it to a file with no data.

Is it possible to add a function so that Activity Files can be &#39;suspended&#39;, so they do not fail validation or trip up the Dashboard analytics, but they do not contain the relevant data at the time?

Thanks,

Daniel</description>

            <p>Hi Daniel I think if you make the dataset private (set the Visibility field to ‘Private’) that should do what you want to achieve. Hope that helps</p>
