    <title>50 IATI Data Tips</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/50-iati-data-tips/779</link>
    <description>Ah, sorry if you were expecting a list of IATI data tips !

Instead, I wanted to point at this **[fantastic guide to Humanitarian data](https://simonbjohnson.github.io/im-tips/#/frontcover)**, published by [Simon B Johnson](https://twitter.com/simon_b_johnson?lang=en) of he British Red Cross, and shared by @rory_scott

So , the question is: do we need an IATI version? Or a combination?

And, then, the next question is - who would do this? 

At the TAG, I had a good conversation with @rolfkleef and others about an &quot;IATI [MOOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course)&quot;.  Perhaps we need those with a specialism in e-learning resources (if they are still called that!) to be involved... any suggestions?</description>

        <title>50 IATI Data Tips</title>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>There is material available for workshops and trainings. For instance, at the end of the Partos training programme we gathered the presentations and facilitator schemas we developed and (with <a class="mention" href="/u/sjohns">@SJohns</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/pelleaardema">@pelleaardema</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/danielmackenzie">@DanielMackenzie</a>) made a “dump” of training resources as a step towards a “menu” of course blocks (<a href="http://rowdydata.github.io/1-programmes.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://rowdydata.github.io/1-programmes.html</a>)</p>
<p>As <a class="mention" href="/u/stevieflow">@stevieflow</a> said: I think we can combine a lot of what the IATI community has to offer into a MOOC: a course that could be run at regular intervals, with a few weeks of online interaction and support.</p>
<p>Some of the materials might slot into such a course immediately, but a lot needs more work to be scripted into a proper course: we should create course videos etc.</p>
<p>One target group might be potential trainers or “School of Data” groups who can implement a support programme in their “neighbourhood” (organisational network, country, region).</p>
<p>Another (more ambitious) target would be to have an online course for actual IATI Officers within organisations: how do you start an IATI implementation project, etc. That could help scale from 500 to 15000 publishers…</p>
<p>From our experiences: it’s still a bit more work than consolidating what’s out there <img src="//discuss.iatistandard.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>I think it would be fantastic to have such a resource, though I don’t know how much is already available - in other words, is it an issue of creating it from scratch, or rather of consolidating what’s out there, or even updating/expanding an existing product?</p>
