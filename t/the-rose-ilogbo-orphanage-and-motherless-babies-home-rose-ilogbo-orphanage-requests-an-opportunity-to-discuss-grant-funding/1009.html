          <p>The Rose Ilogbo Orphanage and Motherless Babies Home (Rose Ilogbo Orphanage) requests an opportunity to discuss grant funding that will help house and care for up to 40 Highly Vulnerable Children (HVC)  in the town of Ughelli, Delta State Nigeria, West Africa.</p>
<p>Introduction<br>
HVC are increasing at alarming rates worldwide  and helping them at any level is challenging.  In Africa, relief comes primarily from local, grassroots efforts with little outside financial support.  One such effort, the Rose Ilogbo Orphanage, provides housing and care for 22 HVC in Ughelli, Delta State Nigeria, West Africa.</p>
<p>Due to urbanization, industrialization, and other 21st century challenges – and a consequent lack of viable parental oversight – HVC have very few options and end up living a derelict life on the street.  They are HVC because either both parents have died from HIV/AIDS; their mothers were deserted, widowed, or divorced; or they came from an unwanted pregnancy. Consequently, they are left without love, care and support and must carve out a bleak existence on the street. They quickly become involved in anti-social and criminal activities in a cruel struggle to survive.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, HVC are often subject to social ostracization and isolation due to deeply-held traditional beliefs.  This creates a significant challenge for potential caregivers to rescue and care for them.  Regardless, the Rose Ilogbo Orphanage – a strategically located Non-Governmental Organization (NGO)  – is currently providing “Essential Services”  to 22 HVC in the town of Ughelli, Delta State Nigeria, West Africa.</p>
<p>Mission<br>
The mission of the Rose Ilogbo Orphanage is to provide up to 40 HVC a safe and reasonably normal life through the provision of shelter, food, and education and to find them foster homes.</p>
<p>Proposal<br>
The Rose Ilogbo Orphanage seeks funding to expand its current capacity to serve up to 40 HVC in Ughelli, Delta State Nigeria, West Africa.  Specifically, we want to hire one caretaker, one teacher, one vocational instructor, one cook, one attendant, one watchman, one doctor, and one nurse.  A budget is available upon request.</p>
<p>History<br>
In 1993 Mrs. Rose Ilogbo (Rose) opened a day-care service in the parlor of her husband’s ancestral home, initially serving two children from her working-class neighbors.  At first – because of deeply-held African traditions against allowing non-family members in a household – she was asked by both her husband and neighbors not to pursue the service.  Regardless, as the need for day care continued to increase, Rose overcame these cultural challenges and successfully ran her local day-care for over 20 years.</p>
<p>Then, in 2013, her exemplary service to these children was recognized by the Delta State Ministry of Women Affairs Community and Social Development. She was asked if she would be interested in expanding her day-care efforts and start helping more children – specifically HVC – by opening and operating a full-time orphanage.</p>
<p>The Rose Ilogbo Orphanage and Motherless Babies Home opened on February 7th, 2014.  At one point, there were thirty HVC at the Orphanage, but fifteen were successfully released to foster homes.</p>
<p>Current Status<br>
There are four babies and eighteen children at the Rose Ilogbo Orphanage. Expenses to manage the facility are currently met through local donations of food, beverages, clothing, and toiletries; minimal monetary donations from well-meaning individuals; and from the personal income and efforts of Mrs. Rose Ilogbo.</p>
<p>Qualifications<br>
For three years the Rose Ilogbo Orphanage successfully provided 30 HVC a safe and reasonably normal life through the provision of shelter, food, and education.  During that time, fifteen children were adopted and 7 new HVC were located and taken off the street.</p>
<p>All HVC at Rose’s Orphanage are registered in school and provided with two sets of uniforms and one set of books. They are given three nutritious meals per day but have limited opportunities for indoor and outdoor recreation as well as training in crafts and hobbies.</p>
<p>The Orphanage currently identifies and evaluates HVC with assistance from volunteers and other local citizens; the local police department; and the Delta State Ministry of Women Affairs Community and Social Development.</p>
