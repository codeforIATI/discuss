    <title>Multi-Country/Regional Composition for Activities</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/multi-country-regional-composition-for-activities/1217</link>
    <description>In an effort to list out participating countries/geographies in multi-country or regional activities we ran into an issue.  I can list out the individual geographic areas which make up a regional activity but am unable to say what percentage of funding goes to each as this is not something we track or care about.  I am wondering if we could lift the constraint of adding a percentage and that the percentage must equal 100% of the budget?</description>
