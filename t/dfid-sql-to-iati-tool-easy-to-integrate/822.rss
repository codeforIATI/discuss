    <title>DfID SQL-to-IATI tool - easy to integrate?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/dfid-sql-to-iati-tool-easy-to-integrate/822</link>
    <description>Hello,

I&#39;m looking to find a short-to-medium-term solution for publishing at IRC-UK, and the other day a colleague from Malaria Consortium mentioned the SQL-to-IATI. I understand that Malaria Consortium and DfID use it to publish IATI data.

I am keen to hear any experiences relating to this tool. To cue anyone that can chip in...

- Which software systems has it been tested with?
- Is there an estimate on start-up times, how long it has taken?
- Would developers need to be brought it, or can non-devs work it out?

I read through the Git-Hub posting, but I would appreciate any narrative people can offer that explains the tech.

Thanks,

Daniel</description>

            <p>Yes, in DK MoFA we are happy users of Dfid’s DB. And we can recommend it - but rather as the long-term solution.</p>
<p>We use it as a data-mart - as a destination for updates, processed by our DataWarehouse.</p>
<p>For us, this has several advantages: We maintain our existing architechture; we complete the etl-process in this internal DB, which can then be copied and restored in our DMZ (avoiding any security / Firewall issues); and we can rely on the fact that Dfid’s developers have created a reliable set of stored procedures to generate the ultimate IATI XML files.</p>
<p>We have added a few elements that wasnt completed at the time Dfid published the current DB - and we have added an API of our own design to provide various additional features on top of the DB (standardises pagination - and an o-data feature that allows us to use Excel to pivot the raw data).</p>
<p>Both the updated version we have made of Dfids DB and our API is mae available on GitHub. I haven’t tried that before, so please let me know if there is something we ought to do better for that sort of publication.</p>
<p>Yours OJ</p>

            <p>Hi John, Hi Ross</p>
<p>Thanks for both coming back to me so quickly on this one. There are some very useful points in the above.</p>
<p>I’ll do a bit more research and get in touch with others who may have experiences.</p>
<p>Any other thoughts, please add more on this thread.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Daniel</p>

            <p>Dan, I know that a few others are either using SQL-to-IATI or have tried to use it - OJ in Denmark, Carl and team in Sida, and Antoon in Belgium. It might be worth a chat with them about how they use the tool - or reasons for not using it.</p>

            <p>Hello Daniel,</p>
<p>There is some narrative text on the IATI website, which might explain the purpose of SQL to IATI a little further: <a href="http://iatistandard.org/201/guidance/how-to-publish/select-publishing-tool/#sql-to-iati" rel="nofollow noopener">http://iatistandard.org/201/guidance/how-to-publish/select-publishing-tool/#sql-to-iati</a></p>
<p>We open sourced the database so I will answer your points as best as I can, if you would like any further information please just reply to this post.</p>
<p>•Which software systems has it been tested with</p>
<p>The database was developed on SQL server &amp; worked with the community edition which is freely available to download - though I am not sure what the licensing restrictions are like if you were to use it in a production setting.</p>
<p>• Is there an estimate on start-up times, how long it has taken?</p>
<p>I am afraid not, this database has been in use since we started publishing IATI data, in some form or other, so we haven’t had to start from scratch in a very long time.</p>
<p>The challenge is not the time taken to set up the database, which could be done relatively quickly by a database administrator, it would be trying to integrate the database with your finance system so that it gets populated with accurate information that is suitable for publication.</p>
<p>•Would developers need to be brought it, or can non-devs work it out?</p>
<p>I think you would ideally have a Database Administrator work on the project and somone who understands processing project &amp; finance data from your core systems using SQL (i.e. the job of creating a custom version of p_populate that’s tailored to your organsation’s needs).</p>
<p>Kind Regards,<br>
Ross</p>
