    <title>UK Development Tracker - user question</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/uk-development-tracker-user-question/383</link>
    <description>A quick question for anyone who has used the Development Tracker.

Have you used the data on Development Tracker to influence your own aid programming? In particularly, have you found the Project Completion Reviews and Evaluations useful?

If so, do you think this information loses currency after a period of time? Is there a &quot;shelf-life&quot; for IATI data?</description>
