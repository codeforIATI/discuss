    <title>Information Required For UN OCHA &#39;Open Humanitarianism&#39; Project</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/information-required-for-un-ocha-open-humanitarianism-project/25</link>
    <description>The IATI Technical Team was recently contacted by Leandro Salazar with the following request:

&quot;I&#39;&#39;m currently working at the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs on a project that we call &#39;Open Humanitarianism&#39;. We are basically collecting information on &#39;Open Government&#39; to start establishing the pillars of our project.

My colleagues and I would really appreciate any suggestions on documents, websites, authors or any other help related to that matter.&quot;
