    <description>[Open for Change](http://openforchange.info/) is hosting an event on the 9th and 10th October 2014 in Amsterdam called the [Open Development Camp](http://www.opendevelopmentcamp.org/).

The event aims to explore the idea of openness and look into many areas of its application within our society.

&gt; *Open is in: open government, open data, open knowledge. Open is freedom and innovation, and the promise to empower us as citizens and consumers.*

&gt; *But is Open enough to cure the world&#39;s pressing problems? Join us in Amsterdam to explore!*

We expect to see a strong IATI presence at the event with existing publishers and donors, along with interested parties joining.

So let us know if you&#39;re planning to go - and we&#39;ll be seeing you there!</description>
