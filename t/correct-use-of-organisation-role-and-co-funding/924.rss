    <title>Correct use of organisation role and co-funding</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/correct-use-of-organisation-role-and-co-funding/924</link>
    <description>We are having some discussions internally on how to use the organisation role. Let&#39;s say that we have three organisations funding an activity, these three would have the role: 1, correct?  If our organisation is responsible for this pot of money and for directing it further, then we are the accountable organisation, role 2. Or are we merely extending, role 3? Is it the implementing organisation, role 4, that also carries the responsibility for the activity and the outcome?</description>

            <p>Dear Bill,</p>
<p>Thank you, we will go with your suggestion. Just to make sure that I understand you correctly, we also hold the role 3, extending?</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>

<p>Given the range of business models employed by publishers I think it is difficult to answer this definitively for all scenarios. My take is …</p>

<p>Correct</p>

<p>I think this is open to interpretation. I would go for accountable - as you are responsible for the whole project. If you are managing these funds in accordance with the funders specific demands extending is an option.</p>

<p>The implementing organisation is only responsible for fulfilling their particular contract/undertaking. If you are both responsible for the whole activity AND are playing an implementing role I would record yourself as both accountable and implementing.</p>
<p>Any other views out there on this?</p>
