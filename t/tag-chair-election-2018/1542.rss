    <title>TAG Chair election 2018</title>

    <description>Dear All
Last week we posted information about the TAG Chair election with a fairly short deadline for nominations - the end of this week (November 2nd) to give us time to circulate nominations, and for everybody going to Nepal to think about who they will vote for. Please take a look at the information on the website and send your nomination (or self-nomination) through to me this week.

            <p>Dear All</p>
<p>We’re delighted to have had such a clear outcome from the nomination process for the TAG Chair and even happier that Steven Flower accepted the nomination to become the new TAG Chair. He’ll take over from John at the end of the Kathmandu TAG meeting.</p>
<p>The announcement on the process and outcome are here: <a href="https://iatistandard.org/en/news/tag-chair-2018-announcement/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://iatistandard.org/en/news/tag-chair-2018-announcement/</a></p>
<p>All the very best to Steven in his new role. We are looking forward to celebrating with both John and Steven at the TAG next week.</p>
