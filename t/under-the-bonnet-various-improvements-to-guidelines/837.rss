    <title>Under the Bonnet: Various Improvements to Guidelines</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/under-the-bonnet-various-improvements-to-guidelines/837</link>
    <description>This is a follow-up from the previous [Under the Bonnet](https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/under-the-bonnet-standard-tuning-issues/735) post, but focused purely on Guidelines. Guidelines are recommendations about how the Standard _should_ be used, but are not mandatory requirements (Rules) that _must_ be followed.

https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Extra-Documentation/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=author%3Ahayfield%20%22Guidelines%20-%22

[This Issues Page](https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Extra-Documentation/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=author%3Ahayfield%20%22Guidelines%20-%22) lists a number of problems, issues and suggestions for improving Guidelines. There are several larger posts grouping a number of related issues (such as [Contradictions with the Schema](https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Extra-Documentation/issues/350)), as well as several smaller posts focusing on single issues (such as an [unclear example](https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Extra-Documentation/issues/344)).

The point at which the issues may and should be updated varies - [contradictions](https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Extra-Documentation/issues/348) should be fixed in a shorter-term to improve clarity, while [Guidelines that are trying to be Rules](https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Extra-Documentation/issues/347) cannot become Rules until an integer upgrade process. Some points should become full Proposals for the [2.03 Upgrade Process](https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/2-03-standard-upgrade-process-next-steps/830).

Comments, thoughts, identification of missed points (there are a few!), and so on would be wonderful (either in this thread or directly on the relevant Github Issue).

(the current set of issues was gathered from the [Considerations](http://iatistandard.org/202/activity-standard/overview/activity-file/#considerations) sections on [Overview Pages](http://iatistandard.org/202/activity-standard/overview/) within the Activity Standard - Guidelines elsewhere in the documentation have not been covered at this point)</description>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/dalepotter">@dalepotter</a> is leading working out what to do with both these points and a range of other things identified through other pieces of work. He should be able to provide more insight into how these things are to be handled than I am.</p>

            <p>This is great work btw, <a class="mention" href="/u/hayfield">@hayfield</a>! But what’s the plan for it now? It’s a few months old, but I don’t think it’s been actioned yet…</p>
<p>A bunch of these just appear to be bugs. Could they just be fixed? Would you accept pull requests for them?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
