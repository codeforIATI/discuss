    <title>Capturing information on funder type</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/capturing-information-on-funder-type/29</link>
    <description>Hi all,

One of the things I/we at GHA would like to use IATI data for is to contribute to our analysis on the various types of humanitarian donors - i.e. governments, multilaterals, private (potentially further broken down by foundations, private companies/corporations and individual donors, for e.g.), and self-generated income (e.g. through charity shops). We can&#39;t however use IATI for this as, at the moment, the only &quot;organisation type&quot; data available relates to the reporting organisation and not (necessarily) to the source of the funds. I appreciate that the number of different fields needs to be limited, but do others feel that a &quot;donor type&quot; marker would be valuable or not? While our interest here is on humanitarian funds, obviously this would also apply for all development funding, not just for humanitarian aid.

Thanks,

Chloe</description>

            <p>Organisation type data can be reported to the IATI Standard for all participating organisations:<br>

<p>A large number of publishers are reporting this data. The dashboard has a summary of the types different publishers are reporting at:<br>

(Note that this list includes non-valid non-numeric values that aren’t on the codelist).</p>
