    <title>Searching in D-Portal by Policy Marker</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/searching-in-d-portal-by-policy-marker/1295</link>
    <description>So I recently discovered that the standard includes the OECD policy markers.  The one of interest for me is the gender marker, but I am sure other users or potential users are interested in other markers.  To my amazement/joy the standard not only includes the policy marker but also if it is principal or significant.  I couldn&#39;t figure out any way to search d-portal for the policy markers though, and then I wondered if any publish actually publishes the information, or its just code that is there because it should be used.  So I searched Canada&#39;s xml and found 895 mentions of the gender policy marker (@YohannaLoucheur congrats), but outside of that I have no idea how to access that information.  I think finding projects by their gender policy marker could be a massively helpful tool for users (myself included), so I have two questions:
1) Is there a way to search activities by policy markers currently besides via the xml?
2) What would it take to make them easily searchable in D-portal?
@AkermanMartin @AVaughn @stevieflow @JohnAdams @Melinda @bill_anderson

Happy to walk through use cases or why I think this information is super important to have.</description>

            <p>Hi, sorry for the late reply. Well, the SAVi i read about on the d-portal about page (<a href="http://www.d-portal.org/about.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.d-portal.org/about.html</a>). I have never looked into it myself so I will be of no help to you there, sorry!</p>
<p>And yes, our Openaid.se is actually built on or IATI files, and the policy markers have been published for quite some time according to the standard. I hope you find what you are looking for.</p>

<p>Straying off-topic, but… All the content appears to have moved from e.g.:<br>

<p>I’ve emailed the WHO contact address and IATI secretariat support about this.</p>
<p>But yeah – I agree that this sort of thing could account for numeric differences. Honestly, so many bits of IATI tech are either undergoing major overhauls or are otherwise in limbo (rather than being incrementally maintained) that it’s difficult to think about addressing this.</p>

</aside>
<p>I find quite fascinating that we all get a slightly different answer to the question “how many GAC activities use policy markers” (2,935 in yours,  2,931 on the Dashboard; Andy said 2,315, but that was specific to the GE marker, which may explain the difference).</p>
<p>The answers are close to each other, but you’d think they would be identical since it’s about the same dataset. Thought I’d flag as it may matter in creating the D-portal filter.</p>

<p>Aria, the easiest way to find the answer to this may be to check the Dashboard [<a href="http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/element/iati-activity_policy-marker.html">http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/element/iati-activity_policy-marker.html</a> ]  The data is not searchable, but it would help you identify which publishers use policy markers.

attribute. <a href="http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/element/iati-activity_policy-marker_@significance.html">http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/element/iati-activity_policy-marker_@significance.html</a></p>

<p>That seems low to me, actually. <img src="//discuss.iatistandard.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  Gender Equality has been an important topic for Canada even before our recently-published Feminist International Assistance Policy, so I would expect all our projects to have the GE policy marker (if only to indicate that a given project does not have GE as a principal or significant dimension). I seem to recall there were changes in the GE policy marker at some point, so perhaps we cannot publish them for older projects.</p>
<p>I wish I could point you to our Project Browser <a href="http://w05.international.gc.ca/projectbrowser-banqueprojets/filter-filtre">http://w05.international.gc.ca/projectbrowser-banqueprojets/filter-filtre</a> to play with data with the GE marker, but unfortunately our Browser does not yet provide a policy marker filter (though they are displayed on project profiles). I would definitely echo calls to make policy markers searchable on the Datastore and D-Portal.</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://iatistandard.org/guidance/datastore/">IATI Datastore</a> is filterable by policy marker, but there some issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>the policy marker filter doesn’t appear on the <a href="http://datastore.iatistandard.org/query/">query builder</a>, so there’s no friendly interface for it</li>
<li>policy marker doesn’t appear in the output CSV (<a class="mention" href="/u/stevieflow">@stevieflow</a> has <a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Datastore/issues/168">raised that one</a>)</li>
<li>you can’t specify the policy marker <code>@vocabulary</code>
</li>
<li>you can’t specify the policy marker <code>@significance</code> (e.g. to ignore <a href="http://iatistandard.org/codelists/PolicySignificance/">PolicySignificance</a> code 0)</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, by way of example, here are 50 of Canada’s activities that include policy marker 1 (“Gender Equality”):</p>
<p><a href="http://datastore.iatistandard.org/api/1/access/activity.xml?policy-marker=1&amp;reporting-org=CA-3" class="onebox" target="_blank">http://datastore.iatistandard.org/api/1/access/activity.xml?policy-marker=1&amp;reporting-org=CA-3</a></p>
<p>^^ According to this, the number of CA-3 activities with the gender equality policy marker is closer to 2,315.</p>

            <p>I agree, it would be useful for many to search on policy markers. We have started to publish them on our national portal <a href="https://openaid.se/aid/2017/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://openaid.se/aid/2017/</a> but we haven’t added the possibility to search by PM. And it is only possible to extract an Excel with the PM’s for the climate data.</p>
<p>Have you looked into SAVi at all? I reckon most of the publishers that publish to DAC publish their PM’s here as well since they already have the data available.</p>

            <p>So I recently discovered that the standard includes the OECD policy markers.  The one of interest for me is the gender marker, but I am sure other users or potential users are interested in other markers.  To my amazement/joy the standard not only includes the policy marker but also if it is principal or significant.  I couldn’t figure out any way to search d-portal for the policy markers though, and then I wondered if any publish actually publishes the information, or its just code that is there because it should be used.  So I searched Canada’s xml and found 895 mentions of the gender policy marker (<a class="mention" href="/u/yohannaloucheur">@YohannaLoucheur</a> congrats), but outside of that I have no idea how to access that information.  I think finding projects by their gender policy marker could be a massively helpful tool for users (myself included), so I have two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is there a way to search activities by policy markers currently besides via the xml?</li>
<li>What would it take to make them easily searchable in D-portal?<br>
<a class="mention" href="/u/akermanmartin">@AkermanMartin</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/avaughn">@AVaughn</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/stevieflow">@stevieflow</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/johnadams">@JohnAdams</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/melinda">@Melinda</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/bill_anderson">@bill_anderson</a>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Happy to walk through use cases or why I think this information is super important to have.</p>
