        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>One of the elements in the original proposal was to add 5 new flow types:</p>
<p>Humanitarian assistance<br>
Peacekeeping operations<br>
Technical cooperation<br>
Normative, treaty-related and knowledge creation activities<br>
Other flows</p>
<p>I doubt that the flow-type element should be used for this classification, since flow-type is meant as a high level classification defining the ‘ruleset’ under which a financial flow is governed (ODA, OOF, Private flows, etc.).</p>
<p>When looking at the attribute values above, I notice these values seem to be more comparable to the OECD DAC Table 1 ‘Aid type’:</p>
<p><strong>Aid type</strong><br>
