    <title>Proposed additions for org-id.guide</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/proposed-additions-for-org-id-guide/1125</link>
    <description>We have a number of proposed [organisation identifier lists](http://iatistandard.org/202/codelists/OrganisationRegistrationAgency/) to be added to [org-id.guide](http://org-id.guide), based on a research work carried out to establish many more entries.

You can view the proposed entries via the list of pull requests currently open on Github https://github.com/org-id/register/pulls

For each of these lists, a preview of the org-id platform can be view by using the list-code in the url http://org-id.guide/_preview_branch/{list-code} (visiting http://org-id.guide/list/{list-code} when the preview is active. 

(e.g. for &#39;Companies Commission of Malaysia&#39; (MY-SSM) visit http://org-id.guide/_preview_branch/MY-SSM and then http://org-id.guide/list/MY-SSM.)

Unless objections are raised, these lists will be merged 7 days after they were created, in this case mostly after Thursday 16/11/2017</description>
