    <title>Improving the results element, phase 1: Unambiguous indicator references</title>
    <link>https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/improving-the-results-element-phase-1-unambiguous-indicator-references/285</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve submitted my first stab at the [phase 1 of improving the `result` element][1], which is making it possible for indicator results to refer unambiguously to known indicators. 

There are two parts to this:

1.  **Adding a `reference` element to the `indicator` element.** [(View on Github)][2]. Note that (a) this is **optional**, and (b) you can include multiple references (e.g. if the same indicator is referenced with different codes in different vocabularies). 
2. **Creating a codelist of Indicator Vocabularies.** [(View on Github)][3]. I&#39;ve started with a few illustrative indicator repositories (US F Framework, World Bank World Development Indicators, UN SDGs, etc). No doubt this list will grow much larger. I&#39;ve added this to the non-embedded codelist repo, because much like the Organisation Registry codelist, additions will likely need to be made on short notice outside of published upgrade schedules.

This is backwards-compatible; no existing tests have been broken.

For now I&#39;ve just straight-up forked the IATI repositories and have submitted these changes as pull requests. If it turns out that these changes are controversial or will take months to be approved, I can refactor them into an extension. I&#39;m hoping that won&#39;t be necessary, and at any rate this seemed like the easiest way to make a concrete proposal. 

Please let me know what you think. 

Cheers
Herb
